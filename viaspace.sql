The principal benefits of methanol fuel cells are a longer use life and instant portability."', 'Andrew Blazier Staff Writer', 'Whittier Daily News', '\r\n<P>ALTADENA -- Automotive fuel cells may be more than a decade away, but for laptop and cell phone users, the future is now. So says Carl Kukkonen, the former director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory''s Center for Space Microelectronics Technology and a leading U.S. proponent of a developmental product that could sap the energy out of the conventional laptop battery market. <BR><BR>Carl Kukkonen (Chief Executive Officer) of Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation, based in Altadena. Carl standing next to slides showing prototypes of laptop computer and cell phone that would use direct methanol fuel cell instead of conventional batteries. The company owns the patents to the direct fuel technology, currently being developed in Japan. The company claims its cell cartridges can power a laptop for up to 10 hours, at a cost of $2 to $3 per cartridge. (Staff photo by Walt Mancini) <BR><BR>Since he took over in 1998 as chief executive of VIASPACE, a high- tech company based in Altadena, Kukkonen has been busy building technology start-ups with science licensed from Caltech and JPL. His current project, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corp., hopes to capitalize on about 35 Caltech patents, with another 34 potentially on the way. <BR><BR>As the name implies, the company is founded on direct methanol fuel cells, which turn methanol, or wood alcohol, into liquid fuel. They can be compared to hydrogen fuel cells. But unlike hydrogen, which has been an untenable dream for 30 years and is estimated to be at least another decade away, the methanol version is already considered a viable alternative to conventional lithium battery power. <BR><BR>"This is not some research pipe dream,'' Kukkonen said at his office inside the Business Technology Center in Altadena. <BR><BR>The principal benefits of methanol fuel cells are a longer use life and instant portability. While lithium batteries can only run for two to three hours on average before needing to be recharged, the hydrogen cartridges Kukkonen hopes to develop would provide five to 10 hours of use apiece, at a cost of $2 to $3 per cartridge. <BR><BR>Once a cartridge is exhausted, a traveling computer user need only pop in another cartridge. No more competing to find an electrical outlet with other users at a nearby Starbucks. And no waiting until a plane lands to again use the computer. <BR><BR>According to Kukkonen, firms in Japan and South Korea alone will spend an estimated $100 million to $300 million this year developing direct methanol cells. Electronics companies such as Casio Inc., Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp., Samsung Corp., Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp. are among those driving a charge to produce portable computers and cell phones - with fuel cells instead of batteries - by 2006. Mass production could begin by 2007. <BR><BR>According to one estimate, the direct methanol market could reach $8 billion in annual retail sales by 2010. Wholesalers, a group DMFCC hopes to join, could see a combined $4 billion in annual revenues. <BR><BR>"This business is huge,'' Kukkonen said. "That''s why we''re trying to get a piece of it.'' To get there, Kukkonen will have to work out an agreement with at least one of the major firms developing methanol cells. DMFCC''s patents haven''t been approved in Japan yet, but a few firms have said privately they believe intellectual property protection will be granted to the Altadena company. <BR><BR>At the very least, Kukkonen wants to license the IP rights to those firms. But he would prefer to develop the cartridges outright, thereby generating considerably greater revenues. <BR><BR>"The fuel cell is a razor,'' he said. "The cartridge is the razor blade.''</P>', '2004-11-13 00:00:00', '2003-07-28 16:28:00', 0, 1, 1210, 1),

This application is directed at homeland security and defense markets. Another application is to detect pilfered industrial items and other contraband concealed under a person''s clothing. ViaLogy Corp. develops and markets active signal processing software solutions based on a revolutionary signal processing technology, Quantum Resonance Interferometry (QRI), which detects and discriminates data obscured by background noise with very high sensitivity and accuracy. This collaboration is directly responding to an increased global threat from improvised explosive devices. The announcement was made by AJ Abdallat, COO of VIASPACE.<BR><BR>The Arroyo Sciences project, code-named DEEPSCAN, combines advanced sensor hardware with proprietary software from Arroyo and ViaLogy. The goal is to produce a network-centric smart sensor with real-time threat isolation software. DEEPSCAN will deliver an integrated computational system based on Arroyo''s proprietary ViaCore sensor fusion engine and ViaLogy''s QRI software. The two companies are evaluating several sensor candidates for DEEPSCAN development. Originally, intended for real-time seaport and airport cargo scanning and analysis of data acquired using X-ray and gamma ray sensors, DEEPSCAN architecture has been expanded now to address scanning of vehicles and people. Arroyo and ViaLogy have also conducted initial trials on concealed weapon detection using an advanced imager. DEEPSCAN''s goal is to detect concealed explosives from standoff distances.</P>\r\n<P>DEEPSCAN technology from Arroyo and ViaLogy is protected by 12 issued and allowed patents and several patents pending. An immediate application for DEEPSCAN would be entrances to critical infrastructure, transportation facilities and border crossings.</P>', '2005-08-31 00:00:00', '2005-11-01 21:12:00', 0, 1, 1222, 1),

According to Carl Kukkonen, CEO of DMFCC, the cartridges consist of a polycarbonate (PC) housing with a thermoplastic bladder used to hold the methanol. The PC offers good compatibility with the fuel and was most attractive due to impact resistance. Currently in the prototype phase, the cartridges feature an 8-10% glass-fiber reinforced PC, but the second generation of cartridges will look to apply a more economical material. The International Civil Aviation Organization had agreed to allow methanol fuel cells on planes starting in 2007, when the first cartridges will likely be introduced in Samsung and Toshiba laptop computers. </P>\r\n<P class=para></P>\r\n<P class=para><B>Longer life</B></P>\r\n<P class=para>Although it depends on the programs being used, Kukkonen says Toshiba estimates that a laptop could run for up to 10 hours on one fuel cartridge that retails for $4 (see table). For a cell phone, three weeks of standby time and 700 minutes of talk time would be possible with one cartridge, but using a video function would reduce that by a factor of two, with a mobile-phone cartridge running around $2. Kukkonen points out that charging is instantaneous, since you simply replace the cartridge, and all these times could be lengthened if a wall plug is used whenever possible. The company assumes roughly two cartridges per month would be used for the three-year life of a device, adding up to 72 of the cells. </P>\r\n<P class=para>Taking into account portable devices that could use the cartridges and their respective growth, as well as what it calls conservative fuel-cell adoption predictions, DMFCC says the worldwide fuel-cell market could grow from 18.9 million in 2006, to 105 million by 2011, for an annual rate of 40.9%. </P>\r\n<P class=para></P>\r\n<P class=para>Tony Deligio ? <A href="mailto:tdeligio@modplas.com"><FONT color=#990000>tdeligio@modplas.com</FONT></A></P>', '2006-10-30 00:00:00', '2006-10-31 14:41:00', 1, 1, 1234, 1);

</SPAN></B>Portable electronics manufacturers currently power most of their products with rechargeable lithium ion batteries.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Some of these lithium ion batteries have had recent problems with explosions and fires and many companies including Toshiba, HP, Apple, IBM/Lenovo and Dell have recalled these batteries. <SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>Apart from any issues of safety, lithium ion batteries are reaching their limit in the amount of energy they can store in a given size and weight.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>While lithium ion batteries give satisfactory operating results in some applications, manufacturers of portable electronics are continuing to add additional features desired by the consumer, which consume more and more power and reduce the operating time of their products.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>All notebook computers have wireless capability and play DVDs.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Wireless television and interactive gaming and Internet are here.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Mobile phones have Internet conductivity, play music and the new phones have television.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>These new capabilities use considerable power and notebook computer operating time is often well below two hours and mobile phones can be even lower when watching television.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Lithium ion batteries also take several hours to recharge.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Manufacturers can always increase operating time by putting in a much larger lithium ion battery, but do not like this approach which increases the size and weight of their products.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Chip manufacturers like Intel and AMD are working hard to reduce power consumption of their chips, but their considerable success to date has not matched the power requirements of the devices. <o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><B>ENTER FUEL CELLS</B>.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Everyone is looking for potential new power sources for portable electronic devices.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Because portable electronics need more energy storage, and because better battery solutions have not been forthcoming, the industry has moved to fuel cells as an alternative.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts a fuel, usually hydrogen, and oxygen from the air directly into electricity without burning.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The conventional way to produce electricity is to burn the fuel in an engine, which creates mechanical power that turns a generator.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>A fuel cell produces electricity at about twice the efficiency of a generator.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>There are many kinds of fuel cells.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Some are being developed to provide power to buildings and residences, some are being developed for automotive use and micro fuel cells are being developed for portable electronics and other mobile applications.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The only output of a fuel cell is water any and possibly a small amount of carbon dioxide and thus produce no pollution at the site of use.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Fuel cells are a green technology.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Fuel cells are considerably more expensive than motors and generators which is a major challenge particularly for automotive applications.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>However current lithium ion batteries are relatively expensive themselves.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>This increased price is willingly paid by companies for increased productivity and by consumers for the convenience mobility. Fuel cells will likely see their first mass commercial application in this next generation of innovative portable electronics.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><B>FUEL CARTRIDGES.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></B>Fuel cells will continuously produce electricity as long as fuel supplied.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>For portable electronic devices, the fuel must be provided in safe sealed disposable containers called cartridges.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The advantages of a fuel cell are longer operation than a lithium ion battery, and instantaneous refueling by simply replacing the cartridge.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>An electrical plug and power for recharging is not needed.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Like current systems a notebook computer using a fuel cell can also be plugged into power, and no fuel is used while plugged in.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>When unplugged, the computer would run for up to 10 hours on a single cartridge.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>A mobile phone would only use fuel cartridges and never be plugged into the wall for recharging.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It?s estimated that a small cartridge would yield up to 600 minutes of talk time and a month of standby time.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Hydrogen fuel cells have several problems.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Among these are how to distribute hydrogen which is a gas, and how to safely store it in your notebook computer or mobile phone.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>A hydrogen gas cylinder compressed to 3000 psi would be the size of a soda can which is too large.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Another problem is that the International Civil Aviation Organization has ruled not to allow hydrogen on airplanes.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><B>INTRODUCTING DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLS.</B><SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Many major companies have decided that the best candidate fuel cell for portable electronics is a direct methanol fuel cell.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>This fuel cell uses liquid methanol, chemical formula CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, directly as a liquid without having to create hydrogen gas.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>This leads to a six times smaller fuel tank and represents the major system advantage for methanol.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Many companies including NEC, Toshiba, <st1:City w:st="on">Hitachi</st1:City>, Fujitsu, Sanyo and others in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region> as well as Samsung and LG in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Korea</st1:country-region></st1:place> have demonstrated portable electronic devices using direct methanol fuel cells.<SPAN>&nbsp;

</SPAN>The IEC safety specifications state that the fuel cartridge should not be refillable by the consumer because of safety reasons, and disposable cartridges are preferred.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>With these safety and rules in hand, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN body, decided to approve the use of methanol fuel cells on airplanes.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Hydrogen fuel cells were not approved.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Local air transportation bodies such as the FAA are now considering the case, and a favorable decision is expected in 2007.<o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>With this progress and regulations, the direct methanol fuel cell industry is moving towards introducing products in 2007 and 2008.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Notebook computers and mobile phones are expected to be amongst the first products.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The direct methanol fuel cells themselves are being developed and engineered mostly by the portable electronics manufacturers themselves.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Getting the fuel cell lifetime up to 10,000 hours has been accomplished.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Miniaturization in order to get the fuel cell into the product is a major development focus as well as cost reduction. <o:p></o:p></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><B>DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELL CORPORATION</B>.<SPAN>&nbsp;

(1243, 'Will Micro Fuel Cells Fly High?', 'The United States has approved the use of some micro fuel cells in airplanes, removing a major market barrier.', '', 'Greentech Media', 'The U.S. Department of Transportation has approved the use of some fuel cells in airplanes, removing what companies have called a major barrier keeping micro fuel cells out of electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones.<br /><p>The department will allow passengers and crew members to carry on fuel-cell systems and cartridges that contain methanol, formic acid, certain borohydride materials and butane -- previously prohibited as flammable liquids -- as long as they meet the agency&#39;s performance and consumer-use standards. The allowed number of cartridges varies depending on the fuel, ranging between 4 and 7 ounces per person.</p><p>The decision, announced Wednesday afternoon, takes effect Oct. 1 and allows airlines to voluntarily allow the approved fuel cells as early as May 30. The cartridges would still be subject to U.S. Transportation Security Administration regulations, which only allow containers of up to 3 ounces in a single quart-size bag, according to the announcement.</p><p>But the TSA doesn&#39;t plan to impose further restrictions, said spokesperson Nico Melendez. &quot;It&#39;s a hazardous material, not an explosive, so it would have nothing to do with us,&quot; he said. &quot;Our goal is to keep explosives and weapons off planes.&quot;</p><p>The DOT decision is a significant step for micro fuel cells, as companies have called air travel a major potential market. After all, regular laptop batteries often run out of power - and can&#39;t be recharged - midair, and many travelers stuck on planes say they would like to have power longer.</p><p>Fuel cells, which produce power by mixing fuel with air and water between a thin, reactive film membrane, hope to fill the so-called &quot;power gap&quot; caused by increasingly power-hungry devices and traditional batteries&#39; failure to keep pace. Instead of plugging in to recharge their batteries, users would be able to replace small fuel-filled cartridges, essentially getting an instant recharge.</p><p>Many micro fuel cell companies have pushed back their market debuts year after year, and some have blamed the delays on airplane regulations.</p><p>Toshiba, for example, in 2005 said the restrictions were the main reasons for its delay and hoped it would launch its fuel cells in 2007, when it expected the International Civil Aviation Organization to remove the prohibitions. It did, as did Canada, China, Japan and the United Kingdom, but the United States and a number of other countries continued to bar fuel cells from flight.</p><p>&quot;Being able to fly on airplanes is a requirement for any product that claims to be a mobile product, and this decision confirms that micro fuel cells can indeed be a mobile product,&quot; said Peng Lim, CEO of MTI Micro Fuel Cells, which plans to produce cells for handheld devices in 2009. &quot;And that&#39;s important because we are [selling] the functionality that you do not ever need to plug your device into a wall again. You&#39;re spending 30 percent of the time recharging your batteries and that ties you down, it makes you not mobile.&quot;</p><p>Ron Pernick, a principal of research firm Clean Edge, agreed that the decision is a milestone.</p><p>&quot;If [fuel cells had continued to be prohibited in airplane cabins], I believe it would have derailed the industry,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;ve now removed one of the most critical potential obstacles to the expansion of this industry.&quot;</p><p>Still, that doesn&#39;t mean micro fuel cells are ready to take flight. Years of missed promises have turned some fuel-cell believers into skeptics.</p><p>So while the restrictions were a major obstacle, they were by no means the last roadblock for the technology, Pernick said.</p><p>&quot;Now [fuel cells] start to compete on other significant markers,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we&#39;re at a point where it seems we have some clarity around the most important market and we know a road warrior can take it on a plane. But can you get enough early adopters to pay a premium? Maybe.&quot;</p><p>Among those hurdles are cost, density (which relates to the length of time the cell cartridges can provide power) and the difficulties of getting customers to switch from familiar batteries, he said. While a small group of early adopters will pay more for extra convenience, the mainstream market will need to see cost benefits, he said, and many people think of the electricity used to recharge batteries as nearly free.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s got to be equal or superior to conventional offerings, and lithium-ion is still a relatively new technology that&#39;s being innovated on,&quot; Pernick said. &quot;If fuel-cell guys can hit the storage density and operational time out of the ballpark and can do it at a similar price, they have a market.&quot;</p><p>Lim said the price for MTI&#39;s micro fuel cells, which are aimed at handheld devices rather than laptops, will initially be higher than lithium-ion batteries, but will come down as volumes increase. He also couldn&#39;t yet give an expected price for the replacement cartridges, but said he expects it will be competitive considering that a gallon of methanol - enough to run most consumer electronics for more than one lifetime - costs less than $1.</p><p>&quot;In the early days, there will be a premium, but it also provides a lot of benefits,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&#39;t have to bring chargers, you don&#39;t need international wall adapters and you can recharge in any place. I really [think] people will embrace it. The value proposition for fuel cells is so high that I don&#39;t think the price is a stopping point.&quot;</p><p>Lim gave examples such as notebook computers and WiFi, for which people have paid more in exchange for greater freedom. In airports, particularly, people don&#39;t want to have to be tethered to electric outlets while they are rushing to get between terminals, he said, adding that people will buy bottled water, when they can get tap water for free at water fountains and restaurants, so they can carry it with them and have it whenever they want.</p><p>The council has asked the DOT to approve additional fuels by the beginning of next year, when it also expects approval from the International Civil Aviation Organization - which approved methanol fuel cartridges last year - to take effect.</p>', '2008-05-07 00:00:00', '2008-05-01 00:00:00', 1, 1, 1243, 1),

More than 1 million Giant King Grass seedlings were planted in the Guangdong Province of China in October 2008. According to the company, the seedlings are now 2 meter-tall plants. Instead of seeds, Giant King Grass is propagated by seedlings that grow into a plant that can generate between five to 10 new seedlings. Therefore, the original 1.2 million plants will be propagated into 6 million to 12 million new seedlings that will be planted on 100 acres. Viaspace plans to conduct another propagation later this year. It is also negotiating to lease more land and expects to have 300 acres growing by September, with additional acreage and plantings under consideration in China and other countries. <br /><br />Giant King Grass is a cellulose-based product and a nonfood source that can be supplied to the biofuels market to avoid the use of food-related products, such as corn, for producing low-carbon biofuels, said Viaspace Chief Executive Carl Kukkonen. &quot;We see this renewable energy segment of our business as an opportunity to participate in the expected growth of cellulosic biofuels as an environmentally friendly, nonpetroleum source of energy,&quot; he added. </p><p>China produced 750,000 tons of ethanol last year and is scheduled to boost output to 5 million tons by 2010, according to China&#39;s Ministry of Agriculture. According to Viaspace, China&#39;s Ministry of Finance has said it will not approve new biofuels projects using food grains, in an effort to protect grain security. However, the central government will offer financial support to develop biofuels from agricultural waste and nongrain farm produce. <br /><br />On March 31, Viaspace filed a 10-K Form for the year ending Dec. 31, 2008, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company reported a net loss for 2008 of $9.8 million, or $0.02 per share, compared with a net loss of $8.9 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2007. It also reported $1.07 million in revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007, which included $866,000 related to the acquisition of Inter-Pacific Arts Inc., a company that had a worldwide license to grow and sell the ultra-fast-growing hybrid grass in addition to its already profitable consumer products business. <br /><br />Revenue for the 2008 fiscal year was $1.42 million, including $866,000 from the IPA acquisition, compared with $253,000 for 2007. Gross profit for 2008 was $812,000, including $617,000 from the IPA acquisition, compared with $96,000 for 2007. <br /><br />&quot;From a strategic, longer-term standpoint, and as we anticipated, the IPA acquisition is generating cash that is being invested in expanding our capability to supply renewable, low-carbon energy sources in the form of fast-growing cellulosic grass that don&#39;t interfere or compete with food-related agriculture,&quot; Kukkonen said. &quot;And from a liquidity perspective, we expect to generate net positive cash flow for full-year 2009 and close the year with an improved cash position.

And on the heels of that shortage comes a price increase for raw material, according to Carl Kukkonen, CEO of Viaspace Inc. Viaspace is working with about five companies in Thailand that are interested in growing and using its trademark biomass feedstock, Giant King Grass, as a cheaper alternative to pricier materials available there now. The price hike has cost money for companies in long-term power purchase agreements that were signed with feedstock price assumptions, Kukkonen says.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Since relying on the spot market has proven to be an ineffective strategy, companies are looking for a more reliable and secure feedstock, he adds. Most biomass power plants in Thailand either direct combust or employ anaerobic digestion (AD) processes, Kukkonen explains, adding that two of the most prominent AD waste feedstocks are from tapioca and pineapple processing. One of Viaspace&#39;s prospective partners in Thailand, which Kukkonen declined to disclose, is developing an AD facility with a pineapple company and plans to codigest 30 percent Giant King Grass with the pineapple waste stream. Viaspace&#39;s prospective partner will plant trials of the grass to ensure it will grow well in Thailand, but Kukkonen isn&#39;t worried. &quot;We&#39;re certain that it will.&quot;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">If all tests go well, that company plans to build several plants that will digest 100 percent Giant King Grass, Kukkonen says, but didn&#39;t release a timeline for the construction of the power plants. &quot;We expect that there will be Giant King Grass growing in Thailand in the next few months.&quot;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">DP CleanTech doesn&#39;t seem as concerned with feedstock availability, but shares in the excitement about the growing biomass power industry there. &quot;Thailand&#39;s abundant resources coupled with its accommodative renewable energy policies represent an excellent opportunity for further biomass development and a priority market for DP CleanTech,&quot; the company says.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><em><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">-Lisa Gibson</span></em></p><p>Source:<span>&nbsp; </span>Biomass Power and Thermal Magazine</p><p>http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5375/trends-in-thailand</p>', '2011-03-21 00:00:00', '2011-03-21 00:00:00', 1, 1, 1251, 1),

The company is merging established briquette technology with switchgrass ecology to create a market-ready energy solution for small- to large-scale applications. The company is based in Vermont with a market emphasis on other states such as New York and Pennsylvania.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">RER manufactures briquettes from grass that can be burned in boilers and furnaces by itself or in combination with other fuels and used on farms and by institutional, industrial and utility customers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">The company transfers grass from &quot;field to flue,&quot; says John Bootle, RER founder, with field inspection, harvest, transfer, compaction and delivery to the boiler as parts of their grass-to-fuel process. He says crop-derived biomass will be important as a future thermal heat source because studies project that the availability of ag feedstocks will be significantly higher than wood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">The benefits of grass biomass, according to Bootle, include faster carbon emission reduction than wood, low-cost sustainability, local production and local economic development. Switchgrass will deliver about 14.4 million Btu per ton, and users can expect to save more than 50 percent on their fuel bills compared to oil, according to RER. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Switchgrass may be chopped, burned or compacted into briquettes. RER promotes its briquettes as having the advantages of more efficient combustion, lower particulate emissions and considerably reduced storage and transportation costs than simply chopped biofuel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Switchgrass grows well in poorer soils, and may be grown in most states east of the Rocky Mountains into Southern Canada. RER is seeking farmers and landowners who would like to plant biomass crops on under-utilized or unproductive land. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Likewise, recognizing agricultural potential from the central region of the U.S., Missouri-based Show Me Energy Co-op is committed to establishing an innovative, profitable model for the production of biomass-based fuels. &quot;This model may be replicated across the country by small producer-owned cooperatives that will provide a positive economic impact on the regions in which they are located,&quot; according to Steve Flick, the co-op&#39;s chairman of the board.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">The co-op started approximately five years ago, consists of farmer stockholders and its objective is to create jobs and economic development through agricultural innovation. The co-op purchases large round bales and turns the grass into a pellet product for combustion purposes. Without impacting the food supply for animals and humans, the group has benefited Missouri by increasing the value of farmland, creating green collar jobs and advancing rural economic development.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">On the West Coast, but with a similar perspective, California-based Viaspace Green Energy Inc. transforms Giant King Grass, which can grow 15 feet high, into pellets and logs. The company globally markets its harvest as a high-yield dedicated energy crop that is a low-carbon replacement for coal to generate power and heat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">While dependence on coal and imported oil has led to a major increase in environmental issues, biomass is carbon neutral, according to Viaspace. The company explains that plant material burned in a power plant releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere but it is reabsorbed when the next crop grows making it carbon neutral. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Giant King Grass can be burned either directly or in pellet form as a replacement for coal or oil in power plants or used to produce biomethane in anaerobic digesters. Giant King Grass is a nonfood crop and can be grown on marginal lands not suitable for growing food crops. Viaspace says the grass is low cost because it yields more than 44 dry tons per acre annually. Combusting grass results in one-fourth the cost of solar or wind energy. Ag-to-energy is predictable and constant, as agricultural biomass can power a plant 24/7.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As pellet demand increases, agricultural pellets, especially pellets from dedicated sustainably grown energy crops will be in great demand,&quot; Kukkonen says.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><strong><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Combustion Technologies</span></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">In addition to an existing supply chain, it is necessary to have the energy generation technologies to capitalize on biomass benefits. Various companies are actively developing boilers and furnaces compatible with agricultural feedstocks that minimize the challenges of slagging or clinkering. <br />Skanden Energy is a start-up company, based in the Northeast U.S., which markets commercial- and residential-scale multifueled biomass boilers using gasification to process feedstocks such as agricultural biomass in in loose, chip, pellet, briquette or bale form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">In addition to the multifueled boiler systems that can process biomass with up to 50 percent moisture, the company markets residential pellet boilers. The boilers range from 30,000 to 10 million Btus. To ensure the feedstock gets to the boiler efficiently, Skanden also provides storage and fuel feeding equipment, including silos, bins, moving wedge floors, bale cutters, conveyors and automatic bale feeders. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;We take automation to a new level,&quot; according to Skanden. &quot;We offer multiple cleaning devices that remove ash automatically from the combustion chamber, boiler tubes and exhaust gases.&quot; The company provides control panels that can be connected to the Internet to notify the consumer and the fuel supplier about fuel and maintenance issues. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Skanden&#39;s multifueled boilers are manufactured with stainless metals that eliminate corrosive tendencies and encourage multifuel use. Laura Colban, Skanden&#39;s CEO, says independent tests have shown the boilers are more than 90 percent efficient. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Colban adds that although the interest in agricultural fuels is increasing, some financial obstacles exist in the short-term with companies receiving renewable energy-releated grants that are restricted to woody biomass technology. &quot;There is a need for agricultural biomass to be on par with other renewable energy sources,&quot; Colban says. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Canada</span><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">, known for its well-established wood pellet industry, is also seeking to enhance agricultural biomass as a viable renewable fuel source. Nova Scotia-based start-up LST Energy has developed a pellet burning furnace with a specially designed burner pot that eliminates clinkers found in previously marketed biomass burners, according to Trussler. LST intends to manufacture and market a wide variety of clean burning furnaces across North America.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Trussler believes the system is an enabling technology, facilitating biomass production by promoting problem-free burning. The use of hay as a heat source was inhibited by the formation of clinkers, which must be regularly removed to ensure efficient burning, thereby frustrating those utilizing biomass fuel, he adds. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">LST hopes its furnace technology creates a bridge between the vast benefits of biomass heat and usable industrial and residential applications. Trussler says the initial market will be the agricultural community, where the benefits of crop resources as a feedstock source can be utilized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">The production of hay as a biomass resource would have a significant effect on rural economic development. According to Trussler, 70 to 80 percent of the money spent on hay fuel would be re-injected into the local economy versus only 10 percent for oil. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Interest in LST&#39;s boiler technology has come from Nova Scotia and the Northeast U.S. The Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture independently tested the boiler and found that the grass pellets can be burned successfully and reliably in its furnace, according the ag department&#39;s report. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Also in the report, grass pellets were compared to wood pellets in regards to combustion performance and emissions, and showed similar performance to that of wood pellets. &quot;No ash sintering was observed and ash discharge was in the form of powder instead of lumped particles, which are usually observed for high-ash biomass fuel,&quot; the report says. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><strong><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Future of Ag-to-Energy</span></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">For the ag-to-energy industry to overcome challenges, Cerosaletti says that &quot;just as people say eat local, we need to heat local,&quot; meaning utilizing local resources, such as grass, when planning the future of thermal energy options. He also says the premise &quot;build it and they will come&quot; may hold true for the agricultural biomass industry. There is a need for a large anchor company or municipality to commit to agricultural biomass as a future energy source, and the result just might be development of more widespread technology and markets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt">Cornell</span><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 10.5pt"> University in Ithaca, N.Y., has initiated a grass energy research project, the Catskill Grass Bio-Energy Project, through the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Delaware County.

As reported by the St. Croix Source on April 19, 2013, Hugo Hodge, executive director of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority, stated that the authority was nearing a purchase agreement<br />with Tibbar Energy, a proposed biomass electricity company on St.&nbsp; Croix. Hodge said that, in a few years, St.&nbsp; Croix will have 10 MW of electricity coming from industrial solar, 5 MW from net metering and 7 MW from Tibbar, for a total of 22 MW being<br />produced by alternative sources. He estimated that at peak consumption, the St. Croix grid only needed 45 MW. That means the WAPA power plant would only need to supply an additional 23 MW. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Tibbar is continuing to plant its Giant King Grass nurseries, and plans to create a 1,000-plus acre plantation to fuel the 7 MW anaerobic digestion power plant. It is testing irrigation options and large scale planting procedures. &quot;We have started to develop an impressive farming operation in preparation of our finalized power purchase agreement (PPA)&quot; said Tibbar CEO Tania Tomyn. &quot;We have purchased tractors and additional equipment. We are proud of our new farm staff and they are integral to the progress so far.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt">&quot;As WAPA stated in the St. Croix Source article, there is a lot of work that goes into balancing Tibbar&#39;s base load power with WAPA&#39;s,&quot; Tomyn continued. &quot;Tibbar will be unlike intermittent wind and solar as we will produce continuous dispatchable power<br />24/7. Our computer system will be tied to WAPA&#39;s and will use the latest technology to efficiently work together.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Tibbar is also continuing its public education and awareness program on a variety of levels. For example, on April 17-18 , Tibbar sponsored and presented at the St. Croix Earth Day Eco-Fair. According to Tomyn and Farm Manager Bob Peets, &quot;We educated hundreds of children from dozens of St. Croix schools about renewable energy. Tibbar was the major sponsor and we had a fantastic turn out teaching children about Giant King Grass and why bio-energy crops are part of our future.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt">&quot;Giant King Grass is growing incredibly well in St. Croix and our partnership with<br />Tibbar Energy is progressing nicely, said Viaspace Chairman Kevin Schewe. &quot;The planned 7 MW anaerobic digestion power plant using Giant King Grass to create continuous, eco-friendly, carbon neutral, green electricity on St. Croix is already demonstrating intangible benefits of educating children about the merits of renewable green energy and has attracted tourists interested in green energy. We believe that using Giant King Grass as a continuously renewable biomass/bioenergy platform is the perfect green solution for the energy needs of tropical island nations and our partnership with Tibbar Energy can prove this concept on St. Croix in the very near future. This project paves the way for other island economies to model similar green electricity projects using Giant King Grass.

The closure has not only affected energy costs, as the refinery provided No. 6 heavy fuel oil and No. 2 diesel fuel to generate most of the electricity on the island, but also eliminated 2,200 direct and indirect jobs associated with the refinery. This has spurred devastating ripple effects on St. Croix&#39;s and the USVI&#39;s economy, including elimination of about $60 million in annual government revenue.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">For the past few years, there&#39;s been a great deal of focus on renewable energy development in the country. Self-sustained, fast-tracked projects are a necessity and strong area of focus, and include<br />wind, solar, biomass and biogas. A project in St. Croix, being developed by Tibbar Energy USVI, is strategically utilizing the island&#39;s year-round warm climate and frequent rainfall to grow a fast-growing,<br />high-yielding energy crop that will be used to produce power via anaerobic digestion.</span><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt"><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''">Exploring Options </span></strong></span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Las Vegas-based Tibbar Construction Services owner Tania Tomyn and her brother Mark, an environmental engineer, learned of the U.S. Virgin Island&#39;s high energy cost situation, and how it has escalated to a serious energy crisis. Considering St. Croix a second home, the two decided to investigate the possibility of launching an energy project there, and along with the rest of the company&#39;s team and multiple partners, are in the midst of developing a 7 MW biogas plant.<br /><br />Resulting company Tibbar Energy had an initial goal of evaluating what organic feedstocks were available, and will be taking part in a fats, oils and greases and food waste joint recycling partnership with the Virgin Islands Waste Management Authority, a recycling option the island currently doesn&#39;t have. &quot;Landfill space is limited, and we didn&#39;t overlook this,&quot; Tomyn explains. &quot;However, those streams are small, and don&#39;t make up volume that creates any significant amount of energy.&quot;</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">The company will continue to explore other organic streams in the Caribbean and on the island, but Giant King Grass-supplied by licensee company Viaspace Inc.- was selected </span><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">as the feedstock of focus for a number of reasons. Partly because it is native to the tropics, but also because relatives of the grass-napier and elephant grass-have done well in the same climate.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Viaspace CEO Carl Kukkonen says GKG has properties very similar to corn straw or stover in terms of combustion and biogas, biofuel and pellet production. What sets it apart from corn straw are its extremely high yields, which Kukkonen says are &quot;10 times the yield of corn straw per acre per<br />year. </span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">He adds that the company is making GKG pellets every day, but electricity production via direct combustion or biogas is the simplest way to utilize the grass. &quot;We believe that biofuels and biochemicals will be a major opportunity in the future, but there are no real commercial opportunities today,&quot; he says. </span><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">The first GKG for the St. Croix projects was planted, initially by hand, at the end of last September. &quot;Then we moved to a mechanized system with transplanters,&quot; says Tomyn, describing the<br />process as similar to transplanting vegetables from a nursery. These initial three GKG nurseries, totaling an estimated 30 acres, are where the plants will be grown to populate the 1,500 acres needed for the project.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Tibbar&#39;s farm team has spent a year in GKG trials, growing in the driest and wettest parts of the island, working with multiple agronomists who have grown some of the largest energy crop plantations in the<br />world, according to Tomyn. &quot;What we have found is that GKG has performed very well with minimal irrigation and likes the tropical climate,&quot; she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">The GKG will be harvested like any silage crop, and transportation equipment will be similar to corn silage equipment, which will haul feedstock to the plant each day. &quot;We will also have silage in storage in<br />silage packs if it is too wet to harvest,&quot; says Tomyn. </span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Other partners in the project include Bioenergy Crops of Spain, Austria-based Entec, which will build the plant, technology provider Layne/Entec, and Denmark-based engineer/builder/operator Renew Energy a/s. Tibbar has also strategically partnered with the USVI Department of Agriculture<br />Commissioner Louis Peterson to further develop large ponds and gutters for maximum water runoff harvesting capacity.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><strong><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Benefits and Milestones</span></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Since St. Croix is an environmentally sensitive ecosystem, it is imperative that a project work within those parameters, Tomyn points out. &quot;St. Croix has other types of renewables like wind and solar, but they don&#39;t provide base load power like our technology. The utility has to keep spinning reserves for<br />those nonbase-load renewables, and our project works with the USVI Water and Power Authority to generate power to the island in the most efficient manner and at the lowest cost.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">St. Croix is similar to a small, rural community, and has the highest energy cost in the U.S., Tomyn emphasizes. &quot;Keeping that in mind, we needed to design a project that created value for the community and made good sense. So how do you add value? By creating jobs and agricultural opportunities, and hopefully an agricultural renaissance.&quot;</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">Tibbar&#39;s project will create 30-plus permanent jobs for 25 years, and additional temporary jobs during the construction phase. The company will invest $70 million into the island within the next two years and expects it to have a very positive effect on tourism, as the focus currently is on showing the &quot;sustainable side&quot; of the island, Tomyn says.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">The most recent milestone the project achieved was the securing of a power purchase agreement (PPA) with WAPA, at the end of June. WAPA approved an interconnection agreement-the result of a study performed to determine how energy produced from Tibbar will be integrated into the grid-and<br />signed a 25-year PPA with an option for an additional five years at the end of the contract. Per the agreement, WAPA will pay 24.5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Tibbar for the first five years, 24 cents for years 6 to 20, and 23 cents for the remainder of the contract.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-bottom: 12pt"><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''; font-size: 9pt">&quot;We are now working hard on design and farm planning and final agreements,&quot; Tomyn adds. &quot;We expect to have permitting done by late fall, then Layne/Entec starts to build the plant. We will be producing power per our June 2015 PPA schedule.&quot;<br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''">Author: Anna Simet</span></em><br /><em><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''">Managing Editor, Biomass Magazine</span></em><br /><br /><a href="mailto:asimet@bbiinternational.com"><span style="color: #007dc3; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none">asimet@bbiinternational.com</span></a><br /><br /><em><span style="font-family: ''Trebuchet MS''">701-751-2756</span></em></span></p></span></strong><p style="background: white; margin: 22.5pt 0in 15pt; padding: 0in; border: currentColor">&nbsp;</p>', '2013-08-20 00:00:00', '2013-08-20 00:00:00', 1, 1, 1260, 1),

(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a company that transforms proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software products that solve today''s complex problems, announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary Arroyo Sciences acquired an exclusive license from Caltech to MUDSS technology. The Mobile Underwater Debris Survey System (MUDSS)&nbsp; was developed to locate and identify underwater unexploded ordnance.. MUDSS was developed jointly by NAVY?s Coastal Systems Station and NASA''s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally the technology was optimized for fusion of acoustic, magnetic, electro-optical mine-hunting and trace chemical detection sensors using advanced signal and image processing algorithms and real-time 3-D visualization technologies. The announcement was made by AJ Abdallat, COO of VIASPACE.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate Swissair Flight 111 mishap in 1998 offered an operational opportunity to test capabilities of MUDSS in a real-world setting. MUDSS successfully allowed the search team to define the debris field quickly and accurately in Peggy''s Cove, located off the coast of Nova Scotia. For this investigation, the MUDSS payload was extended to include advanced Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) and electro-optical identification system (EIS) to locate debris from distances in excess of 110ft. MUDSS operated by combining sonar and EIS technologies in a single submersible, torpedo like vehicle that feeds high-speed data to a mothership via a fiber-optic cable. This package enables the sonar to locate objects on the ocean floor and then to use the EIS to zoom in and identify those objects at closer ranges. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Mr. Abdallat, ?Licensing federally funded RF, nuclear and electromagnetic imaging technology is part of the VIASPACE strategy to deliver information products in transportation and supply chain security, logistics assurance and first responder safety. MUDSS is another key building block in our R&D pipeline. ?VIASPACE plans to deploy MUDSS to enhance the functionality of its maritime risk assessment and coastal surveillance products being developed under partnership with ATLAS Electronik of Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR></P>', '2005-07-25 00:00:00', '', '', 1, 1, 1024, 1),

(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a&nbsp;company that transforms proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software products that solve today''s complex problems, announced today that its subsidiary Arroyo Sciences licensed SHINE technology from Caltech. Spacecraft Health Inference Engine (SHINE) is an ultra-fast rules engine originally designed for on-board monitoring, analysis and diagnosis of NASA?s spacecraft and ground data systems.&nbsp; It is intended for mission critical systems where inferencing speed, portability and reuse is of critical importance.&nbsp; SHINE embodies revolutionary concepts in knowledge representation and manipulation that go well beyond traditional expert systems. Standardized benchmarking studies have shown that SHINE can process over 30 million rules per second on desktop class computer processors. It delivers over 100X increase in inference speed and up to 1000X reduction in the size of the execution environment footprint over the best comparable commercial product. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHINE was co-invented by scientists, David Atkinson, currently Program Manager for Project Constellation Systems Engineering Support Office within the Exploration Systems and Technology Office at NASA?s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Mark James, a scientist with the Ultracomputing Technologies Group.&nbsp; SHINE is the only known expert system that delivers applications to a target system without requiring any additional run-time environment or dynamic memory allocation.&nbsp; By eliminating run-time environment SHINE enables an entire class of embedded knowledge based applications on hand-held devices and microsystems. Over the past 10 years, SHINE has been successfully applied to over two dozen applications both throughout NASA and within the commercial sector including flight hardware.&nbsp; It has significantly impacted operations cost, reliability and safety in NASA deep space missions, including Voyager, Galileo, Magellan, and EUVE.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to VIASPACE CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, "SHINE presents a fundamental advance in real-time artificial intelligence. It will help us deploy sophisticated knowledge bases and computational intelligence in hardware to deliver a new generation of surveillance and personnel security applications.? Currently, VIASPACE is deploying SHINE for developing a wearable DeepLook MicroTracker (DMU) to provide a Wireless Umbilical for tracking first responders in hazardous environments.&nbsp; The DeepLook Microtracker application will synergistically integrate existing and emerging IT technologies to more effectively deploy hard and human assets in emergency response situations. The key technologies are Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags, wireless digital communication, Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) data exploitation for 2 D and 3 D geolocation determination, high assurance geolocation and predictive tracking software, Geographic Information Systems&nbsp; and sensor fusion. SHINE provides a unifying framework for tying all the elements to support DMU operations within high-rise buildings, warehouses, utility conduits, tunnels and underground parking structures. <BR></P>', '2005-07-28 00:00:00', '', '', 1, 1, 1025, 1),

(OTC.BB: VSPC), a company that works to transform proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software solutions, today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. The Company filed its Form 10-KSB with the SEC on March 31, 2006 and all interested readers are encouraged to read the Form 10-KSB to learn more about the business and subsidiary developments. </P>\r\n<P>Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $103,000, as compared with $138,000 in the same quarter of 2004. Gross profit for Ionfinity, a subsidiary, for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $6,000 compared with $1,000 for the comparable quarter of 2004. </P>\r\n<P>Operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $934,000 compared to $156,000 in the same quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter of 2005 operating expense consisted of $185,000 in research and development expense and $749,000 in selling, general and administrative expense. In the fourth quarter of 2004, there was $138,000 in selling, general and administrative expense and $18,000 in research and development expense. </P>\r\n<P>Commenting on fourth quarter and year-end results, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, Chief Executive Officer of VIASPACE Inc., said, ?2005 revenues were primarily generated from VIASPACE subsidiary Ionfinity?s fulfillment of Navy and Air Force contracts. Additionally, the results for the year represent subsidiary Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation?s (?DMFCC?) spending in research and development and other related costs for the development of its methanol fuel cartridges. DMFCC is working to develop the fuel cartridge manufacturing and distribution infrastructure and the Company is well on its way to becoming a leading provider of disposable fuel cartridges. We have a vested interest in the successful worldwide development of the direct methanol fuel cell industry and are working to support the successful commercialization of fuel cell powered portable electronic devices. We believe that DMFCC is in an excellent position to help foster the adoption and implementation of this technology by providing the needed patent protection to the global electronics industry and by working to develop the cartridge infrastructure requirement necessary for commercialization.? </P>\r\n<P>Dr. Kukkonen added, ?We also continue to invest in R&D in our Arroyo Sciences subsidiary, which is developing products and services based on inference and sensor data fusion technology that are critical for bringing more advanced security applications to market. Arroyo?s sensor fusion application platform is expected to allow for the intelligent use of large volumes of real-time sensor data and enables an entirely new generation of applications that up until now were considered to be prohibitively expensive.? </P>\r\n<P>Other income, net, including minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, was a loss of $124,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to income of $132,000 for the same period in 2004. </P>\r\n<P>Net loss was $1,052,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to net loss of $23,000 for the same quarter of 2004. The Company?s loss per basic and fully diluted share was less than $0.01 in both quarters. </P>\r\n<P>Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $432,000, as compared with $288,000 in 2004. The increase in revenue reflects additional billings by the Company?s subsidiary, Ionfinity, on two Phase II SBIR contracts with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. Gross profit for Ionfinity in 2005 was $77,000 compared with $85,000 for 2004. </P>\r\n<P>Operating expense for 2005 was $2,408,000 compared to $317,000 in 2004. 2005 operating expense consisted of $630,000 in research and development expense and $1,778,000 in selling, general and administrative expense. In 2004, there was $275,000 in selling, general and administrative expense and $42,000 in research and development expense. </P>\r\n<P>Other income, net, including minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries was $20,000 in 2005 as compared to $23,000 in 2004. </P>\r\n<P>Net loss was $2,311,000 in 2005, compared to a net loss of $209,000 in 2004.

DMFCC spending increased in research and development and other related costs for the development of its methanol fuel cartridges. DMFCC is working to develop the fuel cartridge manufacturing and distribution infrastructure and DMFCC is well on its way to becoming a leading provider of disposable fuel cartridges. We have a vested interest in the successful worldwide development of the direct methanol fuel cell industry and are working to support the successful commercialization of fuel cell powered portable electronic devices. We believe that DMFCC is in an excellent position to help foster the adoption and implementation of this technology by providing the needed patent protection </P>\r\n<P>to the global electronics industry and by working to develop the cartridge infrastructure requirement necessary for commercialization.? Dr. Kukkonen added, ?We also continue to invest in R&D in our Arroyo Sciences subsidiary, which is developing products and services based on inference and sensor data fusion technology that are critical for bringing more advanced security applications to market. Arroyo?s sensor fusion application platform is expected to allow for the intelligent use of large volumes of real-time sensor data and enables an entirely new generation of applications that up until now were considered to be prohibitively expensive.

They are a critical link in the international supply chain and as such represent a potential conduit for weapons, dangerous materials, drugs and human cargo. A report on maritime security by the United States Government Accountability Office asserts the potential consequences of the risks created by these vulnerabilities are significant because the nation?s economy relies on an expeditious flow of goods through seaports and a successful attack on a seaport could result in a dramatic slowdown in the supply system, with consequences in the billions of dollars.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ''Courier New''">According to the American Association of Port Authorities, US states rely on 13 to 15 ports to handle their imports and exports, which add up to over $1.3 billion worth of goods moving in and out of US ports daily.

VIASPACE Energy&#39;s new patent claims expand the field to include measurement of humidity in emissions streams such as auto exhaust gases and smokestacks, and for internal humidity sensing in fuel cell systems or combustion device exhaust systems.  </p><p>Fuel cells are very sensitive units in regard to the operating level of humidity. If the humidity is too high or too low, the fuel cell will either fail to operate, or operate at an unacceptable level of efficiency for commercial use. The HS-1000 VIASENSOR provides cutting edge, laser based readings of humidity in fuel cells directly from the gas line in near real time. VIASPACE has discovered similar interest in the level of humidity in combustion engine exhaust gases.</p><p>Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of VIASPACE, reports, &quot;We have been extremely pleased with the early success of global orders and the extremely high level of market interest in our new humidity instrument, the HS-1000 VIASENSOR. These new patent claims are based on early feedback we have received from discussions with several large automotive manufacturers and major manufacturers of auto industry instrumentation equipment. With this new patent application, we are adding to our existing large intellectual property portfolio concerning alternative energy products.  </p><p>This patent describes several additional methods to allow consumers to verify the level of humidity within a fuel cell system such as that proposed to power fuel cell or hybrid energy automobiles. The patent further describes use of the device to measure levels of humidity in the emissions of exhaust gases common to combustion engine automobiles that we believe will be extremely valuable in the future. We will be expediting the development of these new versions of our HS-1000 humidity sensor in order to meet what we see as several large new market opportunities in alternative energy products.

(1196, 'VIASPACE CEO Outlines the Billion Dollar Profit Potential for Fuel Cell Cartridges', '', 'PASADENA, CA - May 28, 2008-VIASPACE Inc. (OTCBB: VSPC) today provided a brief overview of both fuel cells as well as the business model for fuel cell cartridges which VIASPACE&#39;s subsidiary, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (&quot;DMFCC&quot;), is pursuing.  VIASPACE and DMFCC CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, states, &quot;Fuel cartridges are the consumable in the fuel cell business.  Fuel cells are like a razor with fuel cartridges as the razor blades.  VIASPACE and DMFCC are helping to build a new industry that, while it does not exist today, has the potential to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue over the next five years. &quot;<p>&quot;If the large portable electronic OEMs are successful in developing fuel cell powered portable electronics, five to 10 billion cartridges per year could be sold with potential profits exceeding $1 billion per year.  There are plenty of risks, but the potential profits are huge.&quot;  </p><p>An overview of both fuel cells and the cartridges business model is outlined below.</p><p>1.	Fuel cells are electrochemical engines that produce electricity directly from the fuel without burning.  Electricity is made very efficiently and fuel cells are a green technology<br />2.	The first market for fuel cells is likely to be in portable electronics.  Compared to batteries, fuel cells enable a longer device operating time in addition to instant recharging, by replacing the disposable fuel cartridge without the need for an electrical plug and several hours to recharge.  The convenience and increased productivity of new power-hungry portable electronic devices such as smart phones currently drives the market. <br />3.	Direct methanol fuel cells seem to represent the fuel cell of choice by most portable electronics manufacturers.  Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, Hitachi, Panasonic and other large OEMs have already demonstrated that notebook computers, mobile phones and other devices can be powered by direct methanol fuel cells.  In fact, we believe that they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop fuel cells and the products that use them.<br />4.	International safety regulations developed by Underwriters Laboratories and the Japanese Electric Manufacturers Association have specified that a fuel must be contained in a safe, sealed and preferably disposable container called a cartridge.  DMFCC is a member of these international committees.<br />5.	With these safety regulations, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the US Department of Transportation have recently allowed direct methanol fuel cells and cartridges to be carried on airplanes by passengers and aircrew.  This is a major breakthrough.<br />6.	According to industry sources, there were 100 million notebook computers and 1.1 billion mobile phones produced worldwide in 2007, and these figures are projected to rise to 160 million notebooks and 1.8 billion mobile phones in about five years. If the OEMs succeed in their product offerings, it is projected that up to 22% of notebook computers and 2.5% of mobile phones will be powered by fuel cells in about five years.  This leads to a projection of 91 million fuel cell powered devices sold.  Independently, Frost and Sullivan have projected that 71 million fuel cell powered portable electronic devices will likely be sold in 2011.  OEMs are currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try and capture this large new market.<br />7.	Each notebook computer and mobile phone powered by a fuel cell is projected to use between two and four cartridges per month over its three-year lifetime.  If the OEMs are successful, this level of cartridge usage amounts to five to 10 billion cartridges per year, approximately five years from introduction.  This is the market that DMFCC is pursuing.<br />8.	While specific cartridge pricing has not yet been determined, cartridges are projected to sell for between $3.00 and $5.00 each, and the overall cartridge industry could be worth as much as $15 billion to $30 billion per year at the retail level.  Consequently, cartridge manufacturing and distribution profits could be in the billions of dollars per year.  That is why DMFCC is in the cartridge business.<br />9.	DMFCC has an established global network of qualified cartridge manufacturing partners that are already trusted suppliers to many OEMs.  DMFCC is already working with Samsung and other companies on cartridges.<br />10.	The OEMs want to sell notebook computers and mobile phones and, while most do not want to manufacture and sell cartridges, they do want cartridges to be widely available.  DMFCC&#39;s investment cost in the cartridge business is much lower than the costs being expended by OEMs on developing the fuel cells.  DMFCC&#39;s manufacturing partners are also sharing in the cartridge development costs.<br />11.	In addition to providing cartridges, DMFCC also has the patents on direct methanol fuel cells that most OEMs will need to bring their DMFC products to market.  DMFCC has stated that they are willing to provide this patent protection to the OEMs in exchange for a cartridge supply agreement. This is another incentive for OEMs to work directly with DMFCC.<br />12.	DMFCC is, nonetheless, dependent on the OEMs&#39; success in bringing fuel cell powered portable electronics to the marketplace.  In order to benefit from their success, DMFCC must be willing to take these risks together with the OEMs.</p><p><br />About VIASPACE:  Originally founded in 1998 with the objective of transforming proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software solutions that solve today&#39;s complex problems, VIASPACE benefits from important patent and software licenses from Caltech, which manages NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Sales of our new HS-1000 Humidity Sensor have grown and some of those sales represent the first uses of that device incorporated into a Fuel Cell Test Station designed to test Hydrogen Fuel Cells in the $55 Billion dollar clean energy sector.  There are a number of major automotive and fuel cell corporations that have the expected need for hundreds of these test stations in the future.  As they evaluate the unit&#39;s performance, we are optimistic that we will see increased orders from these major companies over the next several quarters.  The quarter&#39;s revenue also includes an initial sale of our new Lithium Battery Tester.  We have also seen a substantial increase in the number of contacts from several major fuel cell manufacturers, and the U.S. Government, concerning design of cartridges for their liquid fuel cell efforts. The recently announced final rule from the Department of Transportation allowing passengers and crew to bring fuel cell cartridges on board the passenger compartment of commercial aircraft has been a watershed event in regulatory approval. During the remainder of 2008, we expect to see revenue from our instrumentation business, from our new lines of safe Lithium batteries, our new agreement on AIMS perimeter defense radar systems, as well as other new alternative energy technologies.&quot;</p><p>About VIASPACE:  Originally founded in 1998 with the objective of transforming proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software solutions that solve today&#39;s complex problems, VIASPACE benefits from important patent and software licenses from Caltech, which manages NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

(1207, 'VIASPACE CEO Comments On Current Orders In The Potential Billion Dollar Fuel Cell Cartridge Business', '', 'PASADENA, CA -July 29, 2008-VIASPACE Inc. (OTCBB: VSPC) today provided comments on the company&#39;s plan for success for fuel cell cartridges which VIASPACE&#39;s subsidiary, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (&quot;DMFCC&quot;), is pursuing.  VIASPACE and DMFCC CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, stated, &quot;Fuel cartridges are the consumable in the portable fuel cell business. Your future notebook computer or mobile phone powered by a fuel-cell will consume two to four disposable fuel cartridges each month.  Fuel cells are equivalent to a razor with fuel cartridges acting as the razor blades, or a computer printer with disposable printer cartridges.  Currently DMFCC had multiple orders for development of fuel cartridges from fuel-cell developers and OEMs.  We are helping to build this new industry that, while it does not exist today, has the potential to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue over the next five years. &quot;<br />&quot;An article yesterday in Computerworld provides additional support. Excerpts are provided below.&quot;  <br />Beyond batteries: fuel cells are the future<br />Methanol is tipped to replace Lithium as laptops&#39; power source<br />By Brian Nadel Framingham | Monday, 28 July, 2008<br />Whether you&#39;re talking on a cellphone, listening to tunes on a media player or typing on a notebook, it&#39;s a good bet that the device&#39;s battery won&#39;t last as long as you&#39;d like. However, that will change over the next few years, as fuel cells designed to power mobile gear start to become common. For the past decade, direct methanol fuel cells have seemed to be tantalizingly close to commercialization, but they never quite made it to market. In particular, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) will deliver as much as 10 hours of power using a thimbleful of methanol--- that&#39;s two to three times the life of current laptop batteries. Finally, they really do appear ready, with several major manufacturers of batteries, fuel cells and mobile devices saying that 2009 will be the start of the fuel-cell era...<p>...Here&#39;s the lowdown on this promising technology, how it will affect your mobile lifestyle and when you likely will be able to use it.</p><p>Bye-bye batteries<br />...&quot;The transition to fuel cells has already started, although it won&#39;t happen overnight,&quot; says Sara Bradford, principal consultant for the energy and power systems group at market analyst firm Frost &amp; Sullivan. She points out that the first external fuel-cell power packs are just hitting the market....</p><p>...&quot;Next year, look for a smart phone that has a fuel-cell option,&quot; says Sean Collins, vice president for business development at Toshiba America Electronic Components. While the engineering and marketing details haven&#39;t been worked out, Collins adds that several phone makers are looking to sell products with a traditional battery as well as an optional fuel cell that fits in the same space....</p><p>...Besides improving technology, another factor that should spur adoption of fuel cells is the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today, fuel cells and methanol are big no-nos on planes, but that will change in October, when the FAA will start allowing travelers to bring fuel cells on board airliners along with two refills of methanol...</p><p>...Because fuel cells will soon be able to go anywhere users go, sales are forecast to grow quickly. Frost &amp; Sullivan&#39;s Bradford thinks that by 2012, 80 million micro fuel cells will be sold to power notebooks, cellphones, media players and other portable devices. That&#39;s up from 1 million fuel cells shipped in 2007 and a projected 25 million fuel cells in 2010....</p><p>...A glimpse of the (near) future<br />Fast-forward to a business traveler on her way to Asia with a notebook full of work to do. Before getting on the plane, she stops at an airport convenience store to buy two methanol refill cartridges for her notebook and stashes them in her bag.</p><p>On the 15-hour flight, she puts the finishing touches on her presentation, clears out a backlog of emails and writes a memo about a new product. Before settling down to watch a DVD or two, she gets a warning that her notebook&#39;s fuel cell is running low on fuel. After replacing its methanol tank with a fresh one, she enjoys a movie marathon for the rest of the flight without interruption. Such prolonged use of a laptop simply isn&#39;t possible today....</p><p>Kukkonen concludes, &quot;With the apparent introduction of fuel cells beginning, the disposable cartridge business will be bigger than the fuel cell business. Third party projections are for use of between 20 and 30 cartridges per notebook per year. The cartridge customer is the consumer who bought the fuel cell powered notebook computer, and now needs to buy cartridges in the aftermarket. That business potential exceeds several billion dollars per year. We feel that DMFCC is well-positioned to achieve a substantial portion of that potential market.  The business has substantial risks, but potentially a very high payoff.&quot;<br />About VIASPACE:  Originally founded in 1998 with the objective of transforming proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software solutions that solve today&#39;s complex problems, VIASPACE benefits from important patent and software licenses from Caltech, which manages NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The contract was recently featured in Defense News:<br />Sniffing Out Bombs From a Distance<br />Sensor Will Sample Air, Measure Molecules<br />By william matthews <br />Published: 18 August 2008<br />The U.S. Army hopes a relatively new technology called differential mobility spectrometry can be built into small, rugged sensors and used to detect the nefarious roadside bombs that cause so many casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. <br />The technology, which is capable of &quot;sniffing&quot; biological agents as well as chemical vapors, could also serve as an all-purpose battlefield chemical and biological weapon sensor.<br />The Army has hired several companies to build fast, super-sensitive detectors to protect soldiers.<br />One of them, Ionfinity, says it plans to build a sensor capable of detecting roadside bombs from a distance of about 100 feet. The device works by detecting miniscule amounts of explosives that seep out of the bombs, said James Weiss, chief executive of the Pasadena, Calif., firm.<br />Many types of explosives, including those commonly used in roadside bombs, suicide vests and land mines, emit vapors that contain molecules of the explosives. That&#39;s how dogs are able to sniff out explosives hidden in luggage or shipping containers.<br />Airport bomb detectors called puffers work on the same principle. Jets of air are &quot;puffed&quot; at passengers and then sampled for traces of explosives.<br />But detecting explosive vapors at a distance has been an elusive capability.<br />Weiss said the detector Ionfinity is building should be able to detect vapors from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) as far as 30 meters away, &quot;assuming the wind is not at your back.&quot;<br />It works by taking in air samples or gas samples created by heating a liquid or solid, ionizing molecules from the sample, then measuring their mass. Since each molecule has a molecular mass, it is possible to identify what&#39;s in the air by determining each molecule&#39;s weight.<br />The molecules are ionized by removing an electron, a process called soft ionization. (Another process, hard ionization, breaks the molecule into fragments and is not used in this sensor.) <br />Since electrons have negligible mass, removing an electron does not change the molecular weight. But ionization gives the molecule an electrical charge, and that charge causes the molecule to oscillate when exposed to an electrical field. By measuring the molecule&#39;s movement, the sensor identifies the molecule, Weiss said. <br />All of this - sampling, ionizing, analyzing - takes about six seconds, Ionfinity says.<br />A micro-gas chromatograph may be incorporated in the sensor to double check and confirm the detection results, Weiss said.<br />The sensor will be able to detect traces of explosives in concentrations as scant as &quot;parts per trillion,&quot; Weiss said. &quot;That&#39;s the level dogs can smell. It&#39;s very rare. I don&#39;t think there is another instrument that can detect at that level. If there is, it&#39;s only looking at one molecule - we&#39;re looking at everything.&quot;<br />A less advanced version of the sensor is already undergoing evaluation. It&#39;s called Juno and was produced by General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products for detecting chemical warfare agents. It is sensitive to chemical concentrations of parts per million, Weiss said. &quot;We&#39;re enhancing that capability.&quot;<br />One part per million is roughly equivalent to one drop in a tank containing about 13 gallons. One part per trillion is one drop in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools.<br />Ionfinity expects to have completed field demonstrations and be ready to begin production in about two years, Weiss said.<br />The company said it has received a $750,000 contract from the Army&#39;s Small Business Technology Transfer program.<br />Army program manager Gary Gilbert said developing a sensor that can detect IEDs at a distance of 100 feet would be &quot;really something.&quot; The challenge is complicated because IEDs can be buried in the ground or encased in metal or plastic containers that prevent vapors from escaping.<br />Several other companies are also working to develop new chemical and biological sensors using various types of spectrometry, he said.<br />One of the Army&#39;s requirements is for a chemical and biological agent detector that can be attached to a robot and driven to an IED, a weapons cache or a suspicious package for close inspection.<br />Weiss said the Ionfinity sensor will be able to transmit its findings wirelessly to troops waiting at a safe distance.<br />Potential uses range far beyond the military. The sensors could be used for environmental monitoring, in agriculture and in medicine, Ionfinity says.<br />NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is among several organizations collaborating with Ionfinity.<br />&quot;Once this sensor has been perfected, it will be ideal for looking for life forms on other planets,&quot; Weiss said. &#9632; <br />Weiss continued, &quot;This new sensor will change the paradigm used for future chemical detection and analysis, making it much more convenient, sensitive, selective and timely.&quot;<p>Interested parties can read the entire article with this link:</p><p>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3679059</p><p>About VIASPACE:  Founded in 1998 with the objective of transforming proven space and defense technologies from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software solutions that solve today&#39;s complex problems, VIASPACE benefits from important patent and software licenses from Caltech, which manages NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The IPA profit and positive cash flow is extremely important for the short term, and the grass business is expected to be very profitable in the near future.<span>&nbsp; </span>These new businesses will further diversify VIASPACE--expanding the investor audience to include agricultural and biofuel investors in addition to the current investor base banking on the Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation high-tech fuel-cell potential.&quot; </p><p>&quot;VIASPACE plans to nurture and expand the IPA framed art business which has generated $5.1 million in sales and $1.5 million in profit (unaudited) in the first three quarters of 2008 (an audit is in progress). The previous owner of IPA has signed on to continue running this business for a minimum of two years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The profits from the framed art business will be reinvested into growing and selling our licensed fast-growing grass for the $40 billion per year animal feed market and as a feedstock for the $25 billion per year biofuels market.&quot;</p><p>&quot;VIASPACE plans to continue to support its Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation subsidiary (DMFCC), which makes disposable fuel cell cartridges for fuel cell powered portable electronic devices such as notebook computers and mobile phones expected to be introduced into the marketplace by OEMs including Samsung, Toshiba and Panasonic.<span>&nbsp; </span>DMFCC has received cartridge development contracts from Samsung and from CMR Fuel Cells. DMFCC also holds important and valuable direct methanol fuel cell licenses from Caltech and University of Southern California. DMFCC remains an important part of our green energy strategy as this market has enormous potential.&quot;</p><p>&quot;VIASPACE will significantly reduce its cash needs by major cuts in spending on yet-to-be-profitable business lines. VIASPACE will focus on its profitable framed art business and expand the development of the green energy grass business.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most yet-to-be-profitable business lines will be sold, scaled back or put on hold, and cost reductions will also come from reducing management and staffing from these areas. With the credit meltdown and the stock market crash, it is difficult and very expensive to raise debt or equity capital to fund business lines that are not profitable.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE has to generate sufficient funds through sales and contracts to cover our operating expenses. We expect that having a positive cash flow will assure VIASPACE&#39;s success, and should increase shareholder value. If we reduce our need to issue additional equity for cash, there should be less selling pressure on the stock and we expect that the market will react favorably to our future plans. The VIASPACE Board of Directors feels these changes will help to move VIASPACE forward and the focus on green energy will lead to increased value for our investors.&quot;</p><p><strong>About VIASPACE (OTCBB: VSPC) </strong>- VIASPACE was founded in 1998 and became public in 2005.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE&#39;s direct methanol fuel cell intellectual property was licensed from Caltech, which manages NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory where the direct methanol fuel cell was invented.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE is focused on green energy through its fuel cell cartridges, and the license for fast-growing grass as a feedstock for nonfood crop biofuels, and with current grass markets as feed for dairy cows, pigs, sheep, goats, fish and other animals.

VIASPACE is taking a leadership position in the development of feedstock for sustainable biofuels, targeting the growing $25 billion global biofuels market. <span>&nbsp;</span>The Company is working to develop supply contracts with companies in China and also expand into other worldwide markets. VIASPACE expects to generate $20 million in revenue in the next two years selling this high-yield grass for <span>&nbsp;</span>alternative fuels as well as livestock feed. <p>Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of VIASPACE, commented: &quot;Nations worldwide are utilizing biofuels to reduce greenhouse emissions, decrease reliance on fossil fuels and meet rising fuel requirements. For biofuels to be truly effective they must be sustainable, net energy efficient, carbon neutral and generated from sources that don&#39;t impact the food supply. Producing biofuels from cellulose-rich biomass like grasses and plant stalks rather than corn or other food grains solves the &lsquo;food versus fuel&#39; dilemma affecting corn-based ethanol. VIASPACE&#39;s fast-growing perennial grass meets all criteria for a sustainable energy crop and we expect it to play a pivotal role in the bright future for all clean transportation fuels.&quot;</p><p>The U.S. Department of Energy expects global production of biofuels to more than double by 2030, projecting output will increase from 1.3 million barrels per day in 2010 to 2.7 million. Within the last year the DOE has announced that it will invest $1 billion in biofuels research and development; $114 million in small-scale cellulosic refineries, $405 million in bioenergy centers, and $385 million in commercial-scale cellulosic refineries. Clean Edge reports in Clean-Energy Trends 2008 that global production and wholesale pricing of biofuels reached $25.4 billion in 2007 and are projected to reach $81.1 billion by 2017.</p><p>VIASPACE recently acquired Inter-Pacific Arts Corp., a company with <span style="color: black">ongoing profitable operations generating unaudited 2007 revenues of approximately $5 million, net income of $1.2 million, and $3 million in cash and equivalents. Inter-Pacific </span>has a worldwide license to grow and sell the ultra-fast-growing hybrid grass in addition to its already profitable consumer products business. The VIASPACE subsidiary has initiated commercial farming of the high-yield <span style="color: black">grass in China where markets for both animal feed and ethanol are growing rapidly. </span>The China Giant King Grass is a natural, non-genetically modified hybrid that can grow up to twelve feet high in sixty days and can produce four crops per year in tropical and subtropical climates. The perennial grass yields seven times the mass output per acre compared to an annual crop such as corn. It is ideal for use as a low-cost, high yield, non-food based biomass for ethanol and other biofuels. China produced 750,000 tons of ethanol last year and is scheduled to boost output to 5,000,000 tons by 2010, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. China&#39;s Ministry of Finance reports that in order to protect grain security it will not approve new biofuels projects using food grains. Instead the central government will offer financial support for development of biofuel from agricultural waste and non-grain farm produce.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><strong>About VIASPACE (OTCBB: VSPC) </strong>- Founded in 1998 with the objective of transforming proven space and defense technologies<span style="font-family: Verdana"> </span>from NASA and the Department of Defense into hardware and software solutions that solve today&#39;s complex problems, VIASPACE benefits from important patent and software licenses from Caltech, which manages NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

(1242, 'VIASPACE Plants Biofuel & Animal Feed Grass and  Signs Land Lease in China', '', 'PASADENA, CA, December 10, 2008-VIASPACE Inc. (OTCBB: VSPC) announced today that it has planted 1.2 million seedlings of its proprietary fast-growing China Giant King Grass near the IPA factory in Guangdong province in China. Giant King Grass is a natural hybrid perennial grass which is propagated from seedlings rather than seeds. In tropical and subtropical areas such as Southern China, it can yield four crops per year and up to 156 tons of grass per acre per year. <p>VIASPACE also signed a 15 year lease on agricultural land in Heyuan city in Guangdong Province, China. The lease was signed last week in a ceremony with government officials. The lease is for 100 acres, with an option for an additional 1400 acres in 2009. VIASPACE plans to plant Giant King Grass seedlings in Heyuan early next year. </p><p>China Giant King Grass was originally developed as an animal feed for cows, pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, turkeys and fish. Animal feed provides an immediate market for the grass which is also being grown as a feedstock for production of cellulosic ethanol, methanol, biocrude and green gasoline. VIASPACE expects to generate $20 million in revenue in the next two years including the sale of grass for livestock feed and alternative fuels. Agriculture and alternative energy are two of the national priorities of China. </p><p>Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of VIASPACE, commented: &quot;VIASPACE is focusing on green energy with its fuel cartridges for fuel cell powered notebook computers and mobile phones, and on China Giant King Grass as a carbon neutral alternative fuel feedstock. A major advantage of the grass is that it has an immediate market as an animal feed.

(OTCBB: VSPC) today announced that it has sold its non-core security business line to Knovitech, Inc for $479,000 in cash and debt forgiveness.  Former VIASPACE COO, Amjad Abdallat will be the new Knovitech CEO, and some VIASPACE employees in the security business unit are expected to transfer to Knovitech.<p>VIASPACE will continue to focus on its green energy business.  VIASPACE will retain the newly acquired Inter-Pacific Arts (IPA) which is a profitable company with a license for a new fast-growing grass suitable for the global $25 billion biofuel and $40 billion animal feed markets.  VIASPACE previously announced the planting of 1.2 million grass seedlings and the lease of agricultural land in China.  VIASPACE will also retain Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC) which produces disposable fuel cartridges for portable electronics expected to be powered by fuel cells. DMFCC is a cartridge supplier to Samsung in Korea and other companies. With this focus; VIASPACE believes that it has a plan to be cash flow breakeven in 2009.</p><p>Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of VIASPACE, commented, &quot;Our strategy addresses the near, mid-and long-terms with a combination of current subsidiary profits and large future potential.  The ongoing IPA framed art business is growing and profitable.  These profits are invested into the grass business which addresses large current markets as an animal feed, as well as very large future markets as a feedstock for nonfood crop, cellulosic, biofuels such as ethanol, methanol and bio-crude. The disposable fuel cartridges produced by Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation will represent a potentially large and recurring revenue stream when the portable electronics OEMs introduce their fuel-cell powered products into the marketplace.</p><p>.Kukkonen continued, &quot;I strongly believe in the security business we sold to Knovitech.  It should have a bright future, but is not yet profitable.  The sale has provided VIASPACE $479,000 in cash and debt forgiveness which allows us to improve our balance sheet and focus on green energy.  In this difficult economic environment, we have to be creative and make tough decisions in order to survive and thrive.  I believe that the IPA acquisition and our sale of nonprofitable, non-core business lines positions us well for the future.&quot;</p><p>About VIASPACE (OTCBB: VSPC) - VIASPACE was founded in 1998 and became public in 2005.

The China Giant King Grass is a natural, non-genetically modified hybrid with many advantages over other grasses and crops used for feed. This perennial species can grow up to twelve feet high in sixty days, produce four crops per year in tropical and subtropical climates, and yield seven times more mass than corn. In addition to biofuels usage, the crops can be used to f<span style="color: black">eed dairy cows, pigs, chickens, fish and other livestock.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p>Dr. Kukkonen continued: &quot;While the high-yield grass will soon be used to produce biofuels including sustainable cellulosic ethanol, we have chosen to also focus on the immediate opportunity to grow and sell this product in China&#39;s livestock feed market which has a well established customer base, excellent profit margins, and consistent annual growth rate exceeding 15%. Therefore we do not have to wait until a cellulosic biofuels plant is constructed before we begin to profit from the grass business. &quot;</p><p>China&#39;s animal feed industry is valued at $40 billion and as <span>&nbsp;</span>population income rises it creates greater demand for meat products, reports<span>&nbsp; </span>Feed International, &quot;Growth Areas in Global Feed Production,&quot; January 2008. <span>&nbsp;</span>Also, according to China&#39;s National Bureau of Statistics each person now consumes 5% more meat and 10% more milk annually than five years ago. China Daily reports the increasing consumption has created a corresponding spike in demand for feed to produce a growing population of pigs, cows and other livestock.

TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE LOW-CARBON ENERGY SOURCE ', '', '<span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none"><p>Role as Resource Supplier to Biofuels Market Part of Growth Strategy in Alternative Energy </p><p>PASADENA, CA-April 6, 2009-VIASPACE Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vspc.ob&amp;d=t">VSPC</a>), an alternative energy company providing products and technology for renewable and clean energy, today announced plans to expand production of its proprietary grass feedstock that is targeted for use in the production of low-carbon biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol, methanol and &quot;green&quot; gasoline.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span style="color: black">VIASPACE holds a worldwide license to grow and cultivate Giant King Grass, a perennial fast-growing plant that can be harvested four times a year. In October 2008 the Company planted its first crop of 1.2 million Giant King Grass seedlings which are now growing in Guangdong Province in China. These seedlings survived the unusually cold winter and are now 2 meter-tall plants. Giant King Grass is propagated by seedlings instead of seeds, and each seedling grows into a plant that can generate from five to 10 new seedlings. As a result, the original 1.2 million seedlings, now plants, will be propagated into six to 12 million new seedlings that will be planted on 100 acres. Later this year, there will be another propagation. VIASPACE is negotiating to lease more land, and expects to have 300 acres growing by September, with additional acreage and plantings under consideration in China and other countries.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black">VIASPACE Chief Executive Carl Kukkonen stated that Giant King Grass is a cellulose-based product and a nonfood source for producing low-carbon biofuels. As a result, the Company&#39;s plans to supply the grass to the biofuels market are consistent with a growing effort to not only reduce carbon emissions but also avoid the use of food-related products, such as corn, for fuel.</span></p><p><span style="color: black">Kukkonen commented: &quot;We see this renewable energy segment of our business as an opportunity to participate in the expected growth of cellulosic biofuels as an environmentally friendly, non-petroleum source of energy. As an indicator of this growth potential, BP p.l.c. (formerly British Petroleum) recently announced plans to build a cellulosic ethanol plant in Florida and use grass is a feedstock, and in the March 23 issue of <em>Time </em>magazine, Toyota said that the carbon footprint for its plug-in hybrid can be reduced by fueling the engine with cellulosic ethanol.&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black">Kukkonen added that the trend to cellulosic biofuels is also finding increasing political support. The new administration in Washington is calling for a national low-carbon fuel standard, and a recent landmark legislative proposal in California to reduce carbon emissions &quot;would boost the use of biofuels&quot; by &quot;spurring investment in cellulosic low-carbon fuels made from switch grass and other non-food plants.&quot; (Los Angeles Times, March 27, 2009, page A12).</span></p><p><strong>About VIASPACE Inc.</strong></p><p>VIASPACE is an alternative energy company providing products and technology for renewable and clean energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-risk-pollutant energy sources.

VIASPACE&#39;s presentation will be available on its new website, which will be launched later this week at <a href="../">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>.</p><p>In 2008 China ranked first in renewable energy investment and second in energy consumption behind the United States, with the Chinese government strongly supporting renewable energy, including offering substantial subsidies for liquid biofuels and biomass-based electricity generation. China has banned biofuels made from food crops such as corn.</p><p>More specifically, Kukkonen discussed the emerging trend toward the use of nonfood crops such as Giant King Grass to produce liquid biofuels for automobiles and trucks. &quot;Liquid biofuels include low-carbon cellulosic methanol, ethanol and green gasoline, which are forms of &#39;grassoline,&#39; a new term to indicate their renewable &#39;green&#39; sources.&quot; </p><p>Kukkonen also discussed the near-term opportunity to use Giant King Grass to partially or completely replace coal as the fuel source for electricity generating power plants. &quot;As existing power plants are converted to biomass, and new biomass-dedicated power plants are built, Giant King Grass represents a recurring revenue stream from continuing sales not only to electricity powerplants but also to biofuel production plants.&quot;</p><p>Addressing environmental concerns, Kukkonen pointed out that just as people breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, and plants breathe carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, the same process applies to biofuels and biomass. &quot;Using Giant King Grass for biofuels can be a carbon-neutral process. Burning a biofuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but the next crop of Giant King Grass 60 days later absorbs the carbon dioxide. Therefore the process is not only renewable but also results in little or no addition of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&quot;</p><p>From a business standpoint, Kukkonen outlined the advantages of Giant King Grass. &quot;It is extremely fast-growing, and up to four or five crops can be harvested in a year, and it has multiple uses as a feedstock for liquid biofuels and as an energy source for electricity generating power plants. Aside from renewable energy uses, it was originally cultivated as animal feed for dairy cows, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, fish and poultry, which represents a large secondary opportunity.&quot; </p><p><span>About VIASPACE Inc.</span></p><p>VIASPACE is an alternative energy company providing products and technology for renewable and clean energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil fuels and other high-pollutant energy sources.

The webcast is available on the &quot;Webcasts&quot; page at <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AqOAlhbASMEinGXBR6F4x5OuMncA/SIG=112e1fb85/**http%3A/www.thegreenbaron.com/">http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AqOAlhbASMEinGXBR6F4x5OuMncA/SIG=112e1fb85/**http%3A/www.thegreenbaron.com/</a>. </p><p>Kukkonen stated that on June 4, 2009, VIASPACE filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list its majority owned subsidiary, <a href="../re_about.php">VIASPACE Green Energy Inc. (&quot;VGE&quot;)</a>, as a separate public company that is expected to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. He stated his belief that this move is expected to have no negative impact on current VIASPACE shareholders and instead provides significant upside potential if VGE is successful in the marketplace.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>According to Kukkonen, there are three reasons why VGE as a separate company will be attractive to investors. First, VGE will be a pure play on renewable energy through its Giant King Grass for biofuels and co-firing with coal in electric power plants. Second, VGE will have only 8.6 million shares outstanding with an initial share price estimated as high as three dollars, a share price level that would be attractive to investors who are adverse to, or prohibited from, investing in penny stocks. Third, VGE will be a fully reporting company, and this new transparency into operations and financial results is expected to be an important factor in attracting new investors.</p><p>VIASPACE is now a majority owner (59%) of VGE, which is presently a private subsidiary that owns the renewable energy business based on Giant King Grass and the framed art business, Inter-Pacific Arts. After VGE becomes a public company, VIASPACE will continue to own 59% of VGE, or the same 5.1 million shares that it holds today. No new shares are being issued in this process, so no ownership dilution will occur. As a result, after VGE becomes a public company VIASPACE will continue to report 100% of VGE revenue under accounting consolidation rules. Furthermore, VIASPACE shareholders will retain their current indirect stake in VGE via VIASPACE&#39;s holdings of VGE stock, since VIASPACE is not spinning off, i.e. not distributing, VGE shares to VIASPACE shareholders or others. Such a distribution would have reduced VIASPACE&#39;s ownership to below 50% and not allowed consolidation.</p><p>The other businesses of VIASPACE-Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation with its disposable fuel cartridges, Ionfinity with its government contracts, and the rechargeable battery business-will not be affected.</p><p>Recapping his comments during the interview with the Green Baron Report, Kukkonen remarked that VIASPACE&#39;s business in fuel cartridges for methanol fuel cells was a result of its early involvement with Caltech and NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and that its alternative energy subsidiary, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC), has licensed a considerable amount of fuel cell-related technology from Caltech, which remains a VIASPACE shareholder since the Company was founded in 1998. Fuel cells efficiently convert methanol, which is contained in DMFCC disposable fuel cartridges, into electrical energy without burning. Fuel cells are being developed as alternatives to traditional batteries for powering portable computers, cell phones and other portable devices. </p><p>According to Kukkonen, due to the greater efficiencies of fuel cells compared to batteries, and expected demand for fuel cells-and therefore fuel cartridges-by a number of large markets, DMFCC is establishing a large-scale production and supply infrastructure for distributing fuel cartridges worldwide. The Company recently announced a filling and distribution agreement with a worldwide packager industrial alcohols including methanol. DMFCC is working on contracts with SAMSUNG to develop cartridges for their fuel cells for a notebook computer and military applications for the U.S. Army. </p><p>VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE), the company&#39;s renewable energy subsidiary, holds the license to cultivate and market Giant King Grass and is expanding production capacity and seeking supply contracts to meet rising demand for &quot;green&quot; sources of fuel and energy. The Company recently announced joining an international agriculture development group to cultivate and market grass in Tanzania. Kukkonen added that VGE is also pursuing contracts to supply grass as animal feed as a secondary market opportunity. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>Kukkonen also briefly discussed the Company&#39;s other businesses in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electronics and electric-powered vehicles, and advanced sensors for detecting dangerous and toxic materials and chemical weapons. VIASPACE&#39;s subsidiary Ionfinity is collaborating with other high-tech entities including Caltech, JPL and other companies to develop sensor/detection systems for the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>In closing, Kukkonen reiterated that by streamlining operations and expenses, strengthening the Company&#39;s financial condition and continuing to make substantial progress with its clean energy and other high-tech businesses, he expects to achieve positive cash flow from operations during 2009 and net profitability in 2010. </p><p>Recent news and other information, including management&#39;s most recent presentation at a global conference on renewable energy, are available at <a href="..//">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About The Green Baron Report </p><p>The Green Baron Report is a subsidiary of Evergreen Marketing.

The authors point out that cellulosic biofuels are the most environmentally attractive and technologically feasible near-term alternative to oil and possess advantages, in contrast to first-generation biofuels from corn and other edible feedstock, which are consistent with becoming a long-term solution as well. Cellulosic feedstocks can be sustainably cultivated to produce enough biofuel to reduce the world&#39;s oil comsumption by substantial amounts; for example, the U.S. can grow enough nonfood feedstock to replace about one half the country&#39;s total consumption of oil without affecting food supplies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;In addition to biofuels, another near-term use of biomass such as Giant King Grass is to simply burn it, instead of coal or oil, in an electricity generating power plant, &quot; Kukkonen added. &quot;An existing coal fired power plant can replace up to 30% of its coal with biomass. Co-firing grass with coal can be accomplished by a straightforward modification of existing power plants, which does not require the large capital expense of building a new power plant.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is probably the simplest and cheapest way to reduce net carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. However, new 100% biomass-dedicated power plants are also being built, as there are long-term operating and environmental benefits for biomass power plants, compared to coal-burning plants.&quot; <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen remarked: &quot;The opportunities for grass as an energy crop are global and not focused only in the U.S.. <span>&nbsp;</span>Economic growth and agricultural pressures are creating even greater demand for renewable energy from non-food sources in countries like China and India and in Southeast Asia.

(OTCBB: VSPC), a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy, is in discussions with potential customers in Asia and other regions seeking renewable and reliable sources of biomass for electric power generation.</p><p>Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen commented: &quot;We have generated strong interest in Asia for Giant King Grass as a dedicated renewable energy crop for energy producers, including power companies that burn 100% biomass instead of coal or natural gas to generate electricity. </p><p>Biomass-fueled power plants are typically 10 megawatt (MW) to 30MW in power generating capacity. A 30MW power plant-that can provide electricity for more than 200,000 Chinese rural households-uses approximately 460 metric tons of biomass daily. At current prices of about $40-50 per ton for agricultural feedstock, a 30MW power plant uses about $20,000 worth of fuel each day, or more than $7.3 million a year. According to Kukkonen, biomass power plant operators typically look for 20-year fuel supply agreements with extension options.</p><p>Biomass power plants currently use agricultural waste and municipal solid waste for fuel. However, supplies of agricultural waste-including corn straw, wheat straw, rice straw and residuals from growing cotton-are seasonal, since harvests of those crops occur at different times, and the fuel quality of the waste varies with each crop. To reduce these operating and business risks associated with agricultural waste, operators of biomass power plants are seeking a dedicated energy crop, such as Giant King Grass, for at least 50% of their fuel needs. <span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Chinese government is strongly encouraging growth of biomass power plants by offering substantial subsidies for using green energy sources and guaranteeing that all electricity generated from green sources will be purchased by the national power grid. </p><p>Kukkonen added: &quot;We are excited about these recent business developments and the growing trend worldwide toward renewable energy. The potential for Giant King Grass as biomass for power plants is substantial in Asia as well as other regions of the world.

In contrast, other grasses and energy crops, like Jatropha, may take several years before reaching maximum yield. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">A Chinese research project to study comparative yields involved planting several types of grass. In a single growing season, Giant King Grass produced a yield 1.7 to 2.7 times higher than switchgrass, miscanthus or giant reed. High yield is a major advantage for Giant King Grass. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Reiterating the results of an independent analysis</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"> of Giant King Grass as an energy crop, the China National Center for Quality Supervision and Test of Coal confirmed that Giant King Grass has an energy content of 18.4 MJ per dry kilogram (4402 kcal per kilogram) and is therefore suitable as a renewable feedstock for energy production. The analysis was sponsored by a potential business partner to VIASPACE.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">With the potential for supplying Giant King Grass to China&#39;s biomass power plant industry, VIASPACE is negotiating to obtain more land in Guangdong province to substantially increase planted acreage. .<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Due to the competitive characteristics of Giant King Grass, interest in, and demand for, the grass as a renewable energy crop is beginning to increase, and VIASPACE is actively pursuing specific opportunities to grow the grass in other regions throughout the world.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and other high-pollutant energy sources.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a clean energy company growing Giant King Grass in China as a renewable and low carbon energy crop, today announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Beijing-based DP CleanTech Company Limited. DP CleanTech is a world leader in design, manufacture and building of biomass power plants and the largest biomass electric power provider in China where it has already built 19 biomass power plants. DP CleanTech owns and operates these power plants with more than 400 MW of installed capacity through their operating subsidiary National Bio-Energy.</p><p>Biomass is a rapidly growing global market, because of the enormous potential to source biomass for power generation and the production of liquid biofuels. Large quantities of biomass are available from not only the waste products of agriculture and forestry, but also dedicated energy crops like Giant King Grass, many of which can be grown on marginal lands.</p><p>VIASPACE, having thoroughly investigated opportunities around the world, began talks with DP CleanTech in May 2009. <span>&nbsp;</span>DP CleanTech conducted an independent test of Giant King Grass which confirmed its suitability for burning using DP CleanTech&#39;s unique technology. This technology was originally developed and licensed from Denmark, and was improved through numerous projects on multiple fuel types in China. </p><p>The Giant King Grass energy content and ash properties are very close to that of the corn straw which is currently burned in four of DP CleanTech&#39;s 30MW power plants in China and therefore DPCleanTech is confident<span>&nbsp; </span>in the suitability of <span>&nbsp;</span>their boilers using Giant King Grass . </p><p>The next step included under the MOU will be to carry out a live trial to examine the efficiency of Giant King Grass in one of DP CleanTech&#39;s existing power plants by the end of 2009.</p><p>VIASPACE will deliver at least 300 tons of biomass every day to supplement the trial. </p><p>VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;DP CleanTech is the largest player in the rapidly expanding biomass power business, and we are honored to be working with them. We believe that Giant King Grass will be a major source for the industry, because it has high energy content and much higher crop yield than competing grasses such as Switchgrass, Silvereed or Giant Reed. Biomass power plants are encouraged by the Chinese government and given subsidies because the biomass is locally grown, renewable and low-carbon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Growing and harvesting Giant King Grass will also provide jobs for Chinese farmers.

(1282, 'VIASPACE TO PRODUCE GIANT KING GRASS IN PELLET FORM', '', '<p align="center">&nbsp; <strong>Supports U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Proposal, European Efforts to Control Carbon Dioxide and Other Emissions Blamed for Global Warming</strong></p><p>Irvine, CA- October 5, 2009-VIASPACE Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a clean energy company growing Giant King Grass as a renewable , high yield biomass energy crop, today announced plans to produce pellets made from Giant King Grass as an alternative to coal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants across the U.S. and Europe. </p><p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy, pellets made from Giant King Grass and other biomass can potentially replace up to 20% of the coal in an existing coal-fired power plant.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>Giant King Grass and other plants absorb carbon dioxide during their growth. When the grass is burned, it emits carbon dioxide, but the next crop of grass 90 days later absorbs the carbon dioxide, and the overall process can be nearly carbon neutral, and therefore reduces the carbon dioxide emissions of the power plant significantly. Many existing coal-fired power plants can be adapted at modest cost to replace part of the coal with biomass pellets in a process called co-firing.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a single 2,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant, replacing 20% of the coal with Giant King Grass pellets would require approximately 2.3 million tons of pellets per year and yield revenue of approximately $230 million at today&#39;s prices for biomass pellets.</p><p>As reported by the Associated Press on Sept. 30, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) announced a proposal to reduce emissions-primarily carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels-from hundreds of electric power plants and other large factories and refineries in the U.S. According to the E.P.A., these large sources are responsible for 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions that are released each year. &quot;By using the power and authority of the Clean Air Act, we can begin reducing emissions from the nation&#39;s largest greenhouse-gas emitting facilities without placing an <span>undue burden</span> on the businesses that make up the vast majority of our economy,&quot; E.P.A. Administrator Lisa Jackson said. </p><p>VIASPACE Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen commented: &quot;Co-firing with biomass pellets is probably the simplest and least expensive way to reduce the carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, because it can be accomplished by modifying existing coal plants, and not replacing them. Alternatives such as carbon dioxide capture from the smokestack and storage underground are considered much more expensive and not expected to occur for many years. As a result, co-firing with biomass pellets is now being implemented in Europe. </p><p>&quot;As discussed in prior announcements, independent analysis of Giant King Grass has shown it to have excellent energy content and confirmed its suitability for burning in electric power plants,&quot; Kukkonen continued. &quot;With this in mind, VIASPACE has produced a prototype of the pellets for evaluation.</p><p>&quot;Worldwide, 41% of electricity is generated from coal, which produces the greatest carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy of any fossil fuel,&quot; Kukkonen added. &quot;Replacing just 20% of coal worldwide would require approximately two billion tons of Giant King Grass pellets per year, which represents a market potential of more than $200 billion a year. With a high-yield crop like Giant King Grass, to grow the amount of grass would require only modest additional acreage equal to 1% of current world cropland.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass can be cultivated on marginal land where it would not compete with food crops.&quot;</p><p>In addition to co-firing, 100% dedicated biomass power plants are being built throughout the world, and coal-fired power plants are being converted to run on much larger amounts of biomass. According to a Global Climate Law posting on Sept. 9, 2009, at globalclimatelaw.com, company officials at Ohio Edison, an electric utility serving customers in central and northeastern Ohio, say that one of its coal-firing plants-to be retrofitted for up to 80% biomass to be co-fired with a maximum of 20% coal-is expected to reduce yearly emissions of carbon dioxide by 1.3 million tons to 400,000 tons, most of which should be offset by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the biomass crops during their growth. The cost of converting the facility to biomass was expected to be materially lower than installing scrubbers or reconfiguring for natural gas.</p><p>Updated pictures of Giant King Grass are available on VIASPACE&#39;s website at <a href="..//">http://www.viaspace.com/</a> .</p><p><strong>About VIASPACE Inc.:</strong><span> </span>VIASPACE is an alternative energy company providing products and technology for renewable and clean energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-risk-pollutant energy sources.

(1283, 'VIASPACE CEO DISCUSSES GIANT KING GRASS AT BIOFUELS CONFERENCE IN MEXICO CITY', '', '<p align="center">&nbsp; <strong>Presentation Outlines Viability as Energy Crop and Opportunities in Multiple Markets</strong></p><p>Irvine, CA- October 13, 2009-VIASPACE Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a clean energy company growing Giant King Grass as a renewable, low carbon, energy crop, today released a summary of a presentation by Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen at the Biofuels Markets, Mexico &amp; Central America Executive Briefing on October 7, 2009. The conference in Mexico City was held to discuss sustainability, regional policies, future feedstock, and production of biofuels. </p><p>The use of food crops, such as corn and soybeans, to produce ethanol is under attack by claims that diverting food to energy production contributes to world hunger. Other biomass like agricultural and forestry waste-for example, cornstalks and wood chips-are being used to produce energy, but supplies are variable in quality and insufficient for large-scale needs. </p><p>Kukkonen said that crops dedicated to the energy markets are needed. An energy crop that is fast-growing and high in yield would make efficient use of land and, moreover, should be able to grow on marginal land not being used for food crops. The crop should be a cost competitive energy source in addition to reducing carbon emissions. </p><p>According to Kukkonen, Giant King Grass has the highest per-acre yield of known energy crops, and its growing characteristics make it suitable for large-scale, long-term farming. Independent testing has confirmed its energy value, and it is carbon neutral; the carbon dioxide emitted when it is burned is offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide during its growth. </p><p>Kukkonen reiterated that VIASPACE is now growing Giant King Grass as a dedicated energy crop and is developing business relationships with electric-power providers and producers of second-generation, non-food biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol and green gasoline. &quot;Opportunities in multiple markets allow for diversified revenue sources and the efficiencies of scale in large energy farms.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For example, VIASPACE recently signed a memorandum of understanding with DPCleanTech, which has built and is operating 19 power plants fueled entirely by biomass,&quot; Kukkonen remarked. &quot;DPCleanTech has been using agricultural waste for fuel, but they tested Giant King Grass and found it suitable for their power plants. Just one of DPCleanTech&#39;s 30 megawatt (MW) power plants would need 175,000 metric tons of Giant King Grass per year; and the market for agricultural waste is currently around $36 per ton.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Giant King Grass can also be processed into pellets that can potentially replace up to 20% of coal in existing electric-power plants and reduce carbon emissions by that same percentage,&quot; Kukkonen continued. &quot;For a single 2,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant, replacing 20% of the coal with Giant King Grass pellets would require approximately 2.3 million tons of biomass pellets per year. Biomass energy pellets are currently selling for more than $100 per ton.&quot;</p><p>Other markets for Giant King Grass include natural gas (methane) production using anaerobic digestion and generating electricity by burning the natural gas in a small gas turbine; and liquid biofuels-cellulosic ethanol, methanol, green gasoline- that can replace gasoline for transportation. Conversion into paper, pressed-wood products, and biomass-based chemicals are other potential markets.</p><p>Kukkonen added: &quot;Giant King Grass has the potential to be used in a number of large-scale applications and is not restricted to a single market like bio-diesel. This crop is extremely productive, and we believe it can be highly profitable. We are now growing crops in southern China, but we looking for partners and opportunities worldwide.&quot;</p><p>Kukkonen&#39;s presentation and updated pictures of Giant King Grass are available on the VIASPACE website at<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="..//">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>.</p><p><strong>About VIASPACE Inc.:</strong><span> </span>VIASPACE is an alternative energy company providing products and technology for renewable and clean energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-risk-pollutant energy sources.

The Dynario, a charger that can replenish [recharge] the batteries in gadgets like cell phones and digital cameras via USB, went on sale on Thursday on Toshiba&#39;s Web store. The charger is about the same thickness and width as a cell phone, although it is slightly longer than most phones at 15 centimeters. A single 50-milliliter charge of methanol will enable it to recharge a cell phone twice. The next step for Toshiba will be gadgets with embedded fuel cells. Earlier this month at Ceatec 2009 one of its DMFCs was on display inside a cellular telephone but both Toshiba and Japanese carrier KDDI, which was demonstrating the phone, gave no estimate for its release.

Over the next several quarters, the acreage will also serve as a nursery and source of seedlings for planting on additional land. </p><p>Due to the fast-growing nature of Giant King Grass and the Company&#39;s plans to propagate seedlings that could result in geometric increases in plantings, VIASPACE believes it can support the development of up to 25,000 planted acres. Included in this plan are potential projects for 2010 involving 5,000 acres that would be projected to annually produce 200,000 tons of Giant King Grass pellets, which could be sold for $20 million.</p><p>VIASPACE Chief Executive Dr. Carl <span>Kukkonen remarked: &quot;With this new land under cultivation, we have the capability to substantially accelerate the production of renewable Giant King Grass crops that can support large, low-carbon energy projects, several of which we are discussing with potential partners and customers.

Coal accounts for 41% of all electricity worldwide and represents a substantial market opportunity. In 2010 the Company expects to begin selling Giant King Grass pellets. Anticipating new supply contracts and other large energy projects in 2010, Kukkonen stated that the Company is expanding production capacity in China and seeking additional acreage and growing opportunities in Indonesia. </p><p>Kukkonen also reiterated that VIASPACE is partnered with Samsung to make fuel cartridges for fuel cells for notebook computers. By providing the consumable fuel cartridges, Kukkonen expects to generate a stream of recurring revenue; much like the repeated sales of razor blades are generated by the sale of razors. </p><p>As for the expected listing of VIASPACE&#39;s subsidiary, VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE), as a separately reporting public company, Kukkonen added that VGE will offer investors a pure play in Giant King Grass, whereas VIASPACE Inc. represents a diversified opportunity in renewable and clean energy. However, since VIASPACE Inc. expects to remain the majority shareholder and continue to consolidate VGE revenue and future earnings, VIASPACE Inc. shareholders will continue to benefit from VGE growth and potential stock price appreciation.

Using biomass instead of coal reduces overall carbon dioxide emissions, because the next crop of Giant King Grass absorbs carbon dioxide as it grows.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of its extremely high yield and carbon-neutral footprint, Giant King Grass has gained widespread interest from potential growers and power plant owners and operators, including in Asia where the climate conditions and rainfall are ideal, and large tracts of marginal land are available. <span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Kukkonen is meeting with potential growing and pellet production partners in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. He is also meeting with power plant owners and operators from China and India. </p><p>In order to assure sufficient growing capacity to meet expected initial demand, VIASPACE is cultivating Giant King Grass on its existing 250 acres in southern China. The site serves as a nursery for Giant King Grass seedlings that are expected to be needed for a large-scale project of up to 5000 acres anticipated in 2010. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>VIASPACE has recently completed construction of a 20,000 ft.&sup2; production processing facility adjacent to the Giant King Grass fields in China.</p><p>Giant King Grass also offers excellent potential as feedstock for making liquid biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol and grassoline, and to produce bio methane using a process called anaerobic digestion. Recent independent testing, conducted in two laboratories in Europe, by potential customers showed that the bio methane production capability of Giant King Grass is outstanding. <span>&nbsp;</span>Bio methane production will be discussed at meetings in Thailand and Indonesia.</p><p>A slide presentation about Giant King Grass used recently at the Pacific West Biomass Conference provides an overview of the Company&#39;s strategy and is available on the lower right of the homepage at <a href="..//">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>.</p><p style="tab-stops: 184.5pt">VIASPACE recently obtained approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to list its majority owned subsidiary VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE) as a separate publicly traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board with the stock symbol VGREF.</p><p style="tab-stops: 184.5pt">VIASPACE Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated: &quot;We expect trading in VGE shares to begin within the next few weeks with VIASPACE Inc. retaining its majority control of VGE. As a result, VIASPACE Inc. will continue to consolidate and report revenue and profits from VIASPACE Green Energy. In addition, as controlling shareholders of VGE, VIASPACE Inc. shareholders are expected to benefit from future appreciation in the price of VGE shares.&quot;</p><p>VGE&#39;s businesses will include Giant King Grass and IPA, the current and profitable framed art business. In addition to remaining the majority shareholder of VGE, VIASPACE will continue its ownership and operation of subsidiaries Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation, a fuel cartridge company with direct methanol fuel cell licenses from Caltech and the University of Southern California, and Ionfinity, a security technology company with U.S. Army and U.S. Navy contracts.</p><p>Having VGE as a separate public company meets a condition for closing the IPA acquisition, which is expected by February 15, 2010, VIASPACE Inc. expects to soon complete negotiations with its largest shareholder to satisfy the Company&#39;s obligations with respect to the closing. It is expected that current management of both VIASPACE and VGE will remain intact, with Kukkonen as the CEO of both companies, and the shareholder continuing to serve as an officer of VGE to aggressively pursue the profitable framed art business as well as Giant King Grass opportunities.</p><p><strong>About VIASPACE Inc.</strong></p><p>VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

Initial harvests have been used as nursery stock to provide seedlings, which have supported expansion of planted acreage to about 250 acres currently. This expanded nursery is capable of providing seedlings that could develop more than 10,000 acres of Giant King Grass fields.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">From the initial harvests, samples have been sent to potential customers and partners.

We lease the land, hire farmers and other labor, harvest the crops, and manufacture the final product in our new, company-owned factory.&quot; </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Considering the rising trend to renewable, low-carbon energy, we are negotiating to obtain more land in China, and we are also seeking to quickly expand outside of China,&quot; Kukkonen continued. &quot;Confidential discussions are proceeding with potential partners/customers that need Giant King Grass to fuel their power plants, some of which have land available for setting up Giant King Grass operations in their respective regions. As a result, we are in discussions and meeting with companies from the U.S., Europe, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and other countries.&quot;</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen said that multiple independent analyses conducted by potential customers show that Giant King Grass has excellent energy content of 7,900 BTU per bone-dry pound and also has superior methane production in bio-digesters of more than 1.6 standard cubic feet of methane per pound of fresh grass. Its physical properties are similar to corn straw (stover), and Giant King Grass is suitable to be burned directly in biomass power plants and made into energy pellets that can be co-fired with coal in existing coal-fired power plants. He also said that Giant King Grass can also be used to produce second-generation cellulosic biofuels that do not use food crops such as corn for their feedstock.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen remarked that Giant King Grass is an extremely high yielding perennial grass in tropical and subtropical areas. Its yield is much higher than other energy crops, and it can be harvested in the first year, whereas other crops such as miscanthus or Jatropha may take two to four years before harvest. Being a perennial species, Giant King Grass regrows after each harvest and will do so for many years.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;VIASPACE is pursuing joint ventures with well-known and reliable customers that have a long-term need for Giant King Grass as a fuel or feedstock,&quot; Kukkonen added. &quot;Using this focused approach, rather than simply selling seedlings to all parties, the Company expects to develop profitable business relationships that hold potential to continue for decades.&quot; </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>About VIASPACE Inc.</strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

Green Logs have a zero net-carbon footprint, completely avoid the use of petroleum products which also produce net carbon emissions, and burn up to 66% longer compared to conventional manufactured logs currently being sold.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since VIASPACE is vertically integrated-- both growing Giant King Grass and manufacturing Green Logs-- we can offer Green Logs as a superior product and at a lower price than competitors.&quot;</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Green Logs are VIASPACE&#39;s first product for the renewable energy market and, according to Kukkonen, exemplify the Company&#39;s ability to convert the vast commercial potential of Giant King Grass into beneficial, competitive biomass products. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">According to Kukkonen, manufactured fire logs represent a $400 million annual market in North America. With more than 100 million logs-made primarily of wood chips and sawdust-burned each year, he sees a substantial opportunity for Green Logs, which offer the most environmentally friendly manufactured log available. Green Logs also generate greater heat output than conventional logs, and its non-chemical, natural campfire aroma<strong> </strong>makes it an even more appealing alternative.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Green Logs are manufactured at the Company&#39;s grass plantation and processing facility in China&#39;s Guangdong province.

The interview included Kukkonen&#39;s comments about VIASPACE&#39;s renewable energy business, recent developments including the launch of its first commercial product, and growth plans.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>Unrestricted access to the webcast is available on the &quot;Webcasts&quot; page at <a href="http://www.thegreenbaron.com/">http://www.thegreenbaron.com/</a> .<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>In a report issued after the close of trading on May 25, 2010, VIASPACE Inc. was recommended as a &quot;Stock Pick&quot; by The Green Baron Report. </p><p>During the interview, Kukkonen spoke on a variety of topics including: </p><ul style="margin-top: 0in"><li style="tab-stops: list .5in">How the Company&#39;s Giant King Grass can effectively replace coal as the heat source used by power plants to produce electricity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass is carbon-emissions neutral and will help power plants meet their objectives of lower carbon emissions by 2020.</li><li style="tab-stops: list .5in">Potential business partners in China, Europe and other regions where biomass power plants have been built or are under construction, and coal-using power plants are being converted to use biomass. In addition to biomass for producing electric power, other commercial opportunities for Giant King Grass include low-carbon biomethane and liquid transportation biofuels such as second-generation cellulosic ethanol, butanol and biodiesel collectively known as grassoline.</li><li style="tab-stops: list .5in">Giant King Grass offers significant advantages-over other biomass such as corn-since it is a non-food crop and can be grown on marginally productive land that is unsuitable for food crops. It is also very fast-growing and can be harvested several times a year. The extremely high yield of Giant King Grass compared to other agricultural crops being used as biomass provides a distinct economic advantage: low cost-due to very the high productivity of land and labor-and also provides a continual, reliable supply of fuel and feedstock for the customer.</li><li style="tab-stops: list .5in">The Company&#39;s 250 acres of Giant King Grass growing in China can provide sufficient seedlings to plant more than 10,000 acres of new crops per year to support partners&#39; energy projects.</li><li style="tab-stops: list .5in">VIASPACE recently launched its first commercial green energy product for sale in the U.S. Its new Green Log<sup>TM</sup> for fireplaces and campfires is the first manufactured log made from a dedicated energy crop. It consists of all natural materials-Giant King Grass, palm oil, natural paraffin-and no petroleum products are used. Kukkonen estimates that this product can capture a material share of the $400 million annual U.S. market, as its vertically integrated operations-from growing to processing to on-site manufacturing-enable the Company to sell Green Logs at very competitive prices compared to conventional logs, which use wood and petroleum products.</li><li style="tab-stops: list .5in">The Company also anticipates the launch of other new energy projects in 2010.</li></ul><p>Kukkonen concluded the interview by commenting on the Company&#39;s success with garnering international recognition of Giant King Grass as a top candidate for energy applications and entering discussions and confidentiality agreements with numerous potential customers who are evaluating Giant King Grass for their biomass-power projects. Testing has confirmed the effectiveness of Giant King Grass as a coal replacement that is suitable for power plants and biogas production. The Company has the capacity and supply infrastructure to support large energy projects, and its Green Log fireplace and campfire logs, now entering the marketplace, are expected to contribute to revenue growth in 2010.</p><p><strong>About The Green Baron Report</strong></p><p>The Green Baron Report is a subsidiary of Evergreen Marketing.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a clean energy company growing Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass as a low-carbon, renewable energy crop, today announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with privately held RuBa Energie GmbH, an owner and operator of biogas electric-power plants and provider of bio-digestion and biogas energy solutions. As part of the agreement, a test plot of five acres of VIASPACE Giant King Grass was planted at the RuBa facility in Kevelaer, Germany on June 6, 2010.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The goal of the collaboration with RuBa is to produce an alternative, high yield, nonfood feedstock for the more than 4,000 bio-digesters operating in Germany. VIASPACE and RuBa will determine optimal growing conditions for Giant King Grass and test biogas energy production under real-time conditions at RuBa&#39;s one-megawatt (MW) biogas electric power plant. Earlier, Giant King Grass was analyzed by RuBa and verified to have excellent biogas production characteristics. Biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, is burned in an engine that drives a generator which produces electricity and usable heat.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">RuBa is a leader in clean and renewable energy with extensive experience in electric power and heat generation using anaerobic digesters to produce biogas. RuBa also has extensive experience with outdoor and greenhouse crops. Its one-MW biogas power plant is onsite at its company facilities and produces not only one MW of electricity but also one MW of usable heat for its greenhouses. The byproduct of anaerobic digestion is organic fertilizer which can be used on the local crops or sold. RuBa has also upgraded biogas to concentrated methane that is sold to the local natural gas grid. Natural gas is approximately 88% methane.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">RuBa Chief Executive Georg Ruffen remarked: &quot;We are among more than 4,000 bio-digesters in Germany, many of which grow corn as a dedicated fuel crop for biogas electricity production. However, since we expect that Giant King Grass mass-yields will be three times greater than corn, we can potentially reduce land usage-and related expenses-by that same factor while generating the same electricity output. As a result, switching to Giant King Grass as feedstock represents not only a potentially substantial reduction of energy production costs but also an opportunity to grow cash crops on whatever land becomes no longer needed for energy crops. In addition, using Giant King Grass, which is a non-food cellulosic crop, would help mitigate the food-versus-fuel issue that arises when using food crops such as corn. Due to the significance of these comparative benefits, the intent of this collaboration includes distribution of Giant King Grass in Germany and then throughout Europe.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chief Executive Carl Kukkonen commented: &quot;Giant King Grass is a tropical and subtropical grass, but it has also been grown as a high-yielding annual crop at higher latitudes with freezing winters. We are pleased to be working with RuBa on biogas production. Their expertise complements our capabilities with Giant King Grass, and we are looking forward to this new business opportunity.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen added that the five-acre test plot will be harvested to accommodate two specific uses of Giant King Grass. For anaerobic digestion to produce biogas, the grass will be harvested every 25 to 30 days while it is still a leafy plant approximately one meter in height. For direct burning in a power plant or processing into energy pellets, the grass will be harvested when it has developed a <em><span style="font-style: normal">thick stalk, in addition to leaves, and is approximately </span></em>4 meters in height.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About RuBa Energie GmbH</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: left; margin: 0in 0in 0pt" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt">RuBa specializes in consulting, engineering and construction of biogas production and power generation systems.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a clean energy company growing Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass as a low-carbon, renewable biomass crop, said that Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen and VIASPACE Green Energy President Sung Chang are on a trip to Europe, India and Asia to hold talks with potential customers and partners seeking new and more reliable supplies of biomass feedstock for their green energy operations and projects.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In Europe, including England, the Netherlands and Germany, Kukkonen and Chang met with potential pellet customers, biogas equipment suppliers, biogas electricity generators and potential partners for power plants and pellet mill projects. Discussions included Giant King Grass cultivation projects in Europe and Africa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In India, where the demand for clean electricity is rapidly growing, talks were held in five cities where companies that own biomass power plants need a dedicated energy crop for fuel due to issues with current sources of biomass, and companies that sell biomass pellets and briquettes needed reliable supplies of feedstock. Kukkonen and Chang also met with a high-temperature gasification company that uses biomass to manufacture producer gas for industrial process heat. Due to its fast-growth, high yield, ability to grow on marginal land, and scalability to accommodate large projects, Giant King Grass is of significant interest to the biomass market in India. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In Singapore, Kukkonen and Chang discussed how Giant King Grass biomass projects can solve supply problems with other types of biomass now being used to generate electricity and produce pellets in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Thailand has many biomass power plants that use sugarcane waste and therefore have to shut down for a substantial portion of the year, because sugarcane waste is seasonal. Biogas projects are also important in Thailand, and consistent supply sources are needed.

Numerous companies have invested heavily in large plantations of Jatropha for bio diesel, but these investments have not yet produced good results. As a result, many of these companies are looking for alternative uses of their land, including a more efficient biomass crop, and Giant King Grass can provide the solution. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;The major advantage of Giant King Grass is that is it can be harvested during the first 12 months after planting, whereas Jatropha and other crops may take two to four years to mature before the first harvest,&quot; Kukkonen continued. &quot;In addition, we believe that Giant King Grass cultivated as a dedicated energy crop can provide a reliable supply of fuel and feedstock at a price that is less expensive than agricultural waste or coal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Many energy projects depend on agricultural waste as fuel for their boilers and feedstock for their biogas systems, but due to inadequate supply and seasonality, agricultural waste has become very expensive,&quot; Kukkonen added. &quot;Also due to seasonality, there are significant periods of each year where power plants can&#39;t produce electricity and have to shut down, because they have no fuel. With that in mind, and considering how Giant King Grass can effectively address other issues as well, we feel the potential of Giant King Grass in the biomass energy market is substantial, and the interest we are seeing is quite promising.&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC), a clean energy company growing Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass as a low-carbon, renewable biomass crop, reported that Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen made an invited presentation at the Third Annual World Congress of Industrial Biotechnology held in Dalian, China, July 25-27, 2010, where more than 500 business executives, industry leaders, technical experts, government officials and investors attended from around the world. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Industrial Biotechnology is an applied field of biology that includes the use of living materials for engineering, producing or manufacturing useful products such as alternative energy, bio-plastics, bio-chemicals, cosmetics and textiles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The presentation, entitled &quot;Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass: High Yield Feedstock for Biofuels, Biogas, Biochemicals and Fuel for Electricity Production,&quot; is available on the lower right of the VIASPACE website homepage at <a href="..//">http://www.viaspace.com/</a> .</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen commented, &quot;Much of industrial biotechnology focuses on processes to convert biomass into bioenergy, biofuels, biochemicals and other biomaterials and assumes that the required biomass feedstock, typically in the form of agricultural waste, will be readily available when needed and at a reasonable price. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;However, recent experiences in India and China have shown this assumption to be faulty,&quot; Kukkonen said. &quot;While energy is needed continuously, most of the biomass power plants in India run at partial capacity because their agricultural waste fuel supplies are seasonal and not available for parts of the year. In addition many power plants have had to close, because the price of agricultural waste has become too high for profitable operations. The trend in China is the same. Agricultural waste-which was valueless several years ago-is now in great demand and priced accordingly higher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;In both countries, we believe we can grow Giant King Grass as a reliable and consistent source of biomass feedstock at a price lower than currently paid for agricultural waste,&quot; Kukkonen stated. &quot;This is our value proposition and solution for their ongoing supply problems.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen said that Giant King Grass is suitable for an increasing number of applications: burning in biomass electric power plants; forming into energy pellets for co-firing with coal in coal-burning electric power plants; and producing bio methane by a process known as anaerobic digestion. Biomethane is used to produce electricity and heat, or it can be upgraded into natural gas for supplying natural gas pipelines. The byproduct of anaerobic digestion of Giant King Grass is organic fertilizer that can be recycled for Giant King Grass cultivation. Giant King Grass can also be used as a feedstock for producing liquid biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol and green gasoline called Grassoline. In addition to alternative energy, other potential opportunities for Giant King Grass biomass were discussed, including the manufacture of important industrial chemicals, bioplastics, paper and textiles.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

Initial harvests also provided seedlings that were used to cultivate additional land, which brings total planted acreage to 280 acres. This expansion enabled us to establish a nursery for a range of biomass applications such as pellets to reduce coal usage, feedstock for direct combustion in biomass-dedicated electric power plants, feedstock to produce bio-methane and liquid bio-fuels, and as a raw material to produce other sustainable, green-energy products.&quot; </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen added that electric-power projects all over the world are moving toward more reliable and larger-scale sources of biomass to fuel their power-generating plants, because current sources such as agricultural waste are not adequately meeting their continual and growing needs.

Today&#39;s biomass power plants use agricultural waste from sugarcane and tapioca industries as well as field waste such as rice husks.<span>&nbsp; </span>The waste is either burned directly in a power plant or bio digested into biogas which fuels an engine generator set. There is strong competition for this agricultural waste and prices have risen dramatically. Several power plants have gone out of business and others are operating only part time because of the seasonality of agricultural waste which is only available after the food crop is harvested.<span>&nbsp; </span>New power plants cannot obtain bank financing without an assured supply of fuel for the life of the loan-6-15 years. Almost all agricultural waste today is sold on the spot market, and the prices are very volatile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE has been contacted by many companies in Thailand because Giant King Grass<sup>TM</sup> is a dedicated energy crop that would be an excellent fuel for electricity production. It is nonfood related and can be grown on marginal lands and therefore does not compete with land required for growing food.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can be harvested at any time-- just-in-time harvesting-- which solves the problem of seasonality. Giant King Grass can be easily grown by the power plant operator near the plant and it provides a guaranteed source of fuel which is a main requirement of banks before they can approve financing of the power plant. Because of its high yield, Giant King Grass can be produced and delivered to a co-located power plant at a price lower than is being paid today for agricultural waste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Chief Executive Kukkonen reported, &quot;Thailand is an excellent country for energy produced by Giant King Grass. The warm weather is perfect. I visited one potential growing site. I think the Giant King Grass yields should be even higher than we achieve in China.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many companies in Thailand need electricity and heat for their own factories. Plus the government is strongly encouraging clean energy from biomass and gives subsidies to companies that utilize biomass. I met with nine different companies in various industries including leaders of large companies.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have signed nondisclosure agreements and are proceeding forward. Recognizing the potential of Thailand, our friends at DP CleanTech of China have opened an office in Bangkok.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are rapidly expanding beyond their 20 biomass power plants in China and 30 power plants in Europe. Giant King Grass will burn well in their power plants. <span>&nbsp;</span>I am confident that VIASPACE will have good business opportunities in Thailand and other Asian countries.&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

I believe that natural gas will play a larger role in electricity production in the future, as will biomass.<span>&nbsp; </span>A large biomass power plant today produces 30 MW of electricity. Therefore 33 new biomass power plants are required to replace a single 1 MW nuclear or coal plant. It will be an era of smaller, more distributed electric power generation. Giant King Grass with its high yield and low cost can play an important role in the biomass electricity future.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass pellets can replace up to 20% of coal in existing power plants to reduce carbon emissions, and it can be used as a feedstock for new transportation fuels such as cellulosic ethanol, butanol and green gasoline.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is seeking applicants for a new position of Senior Manager of Bioenergy Project Development to lead biomass power project development efforts for the company.

According to VIASPACE, the third-party testing included evaluations of the crop&#39;s sugar and lignin content, several levels of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis to sugars.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&lsquo;These initial results show that a ton of Giant King Grass can yield as much bioethanol as a ton of corn stover,&#39; says VIASPACE Chief Executive Carl Kukkonen. &lsquo;This validates Giant King Grass, a nonfood, dedicated energy crop, as a competitive feedstock for producing cellulosic biofuels.&#39;</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Perhaps most importantly, Kukkonen notes that the per acre yields of Giant King Grass are up to 10 times higher than those of corn stover. &lsquo;With our high yield, we believe that Giant King Grass can reduce biofuel feedstock costs by up to 40 percent, even when compared to projected prices for corn straw as agricultural waste,&#39; Kukkonen continues.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">While Giant King Grass has obvious yield benefits, VIASPACE notes that the crop also has other positive attributes. While it cannot be grown in colder climates, like corn and wheat can, the perennial grass can be harvested several times per year while leaving the soil ecosystem relatively intact, providing advantages regarding soil erosion, carbon sequestration and potential nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Biorefining Magazine article can be accessed at <a href="http://www.biorefiningmagazine.com/articles/5392/a-field-of-promise">http://www.biorefiningmagazine.com/articles/5392/a-field-of-promise</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE reports that the Giant King Grass data was an average of samples measured at three independent company laboratories. The corn straw data is an average reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the wheat straw data is from a paper by Prof. Erdei.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Glucan, a sugar polymer, can be converted to glucose and then fermented to ethanol, butanol or lactic acid (which can be used to make bio plastics). Xylan and Arabinan are also sugar polymers and can also be converted to ethanol or butanol, or to important biochemicals such as acetic acid or furfural. Lignin can be burned as a power plant fuel or used as a fiber strengthener for structural plastics, similar to carbon fiber materials.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is working with companies on opportunities for Giant King Grass to be used as a fuel for biomass electric power plants, and as a feedstock for producing biogas through anaerobic digestion, and as a feedstock for biorefineries to produce biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics. The high tons per acre yield of Giant King Grass makes it attractive as a reliable, low cost alternative to coal and oil for electricity and biofuels production. </span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

The National Hardware Show is an annual gathering of buyers and sellers in specialties such as hardware tools, lawn and garden, and outdoor living. The trade show was an ideal venue for the Company&#39;s Green Log to be presented. Many of the major players in the fire log industry also exhibited at the show. </span><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Chief Executive Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;The Green Log is a product that we have spent a lot of time and effort in developing. We believe the Green Log is the most eco-friendly fire log product on the market, and at the trade show, we were able to educate people about the many benefits of the Green Log.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Mr. Sung Chang, President of VIASPACE Green Energy added, &quot;The National Hardware Show allowed us to get the Green Log name out there. Many prospective customers were at the trade show along with our competitors in the fire log industry. From what was seen at the trade show, our competitors have already identified VIASPACE as a viable contender in the fire log industry. Potential buyers of the Green Log have expressed interest in our product and we are following up with them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Green Log is VIASPACE&#39;s first commercial product made with Giant King Grass.

The pelletization and testing of Giant King Grass was performed as part of this project.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The target customers for sustainably grown Giant King Grass pellets are coal-fired power plants initially in Europe that are committed to reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by replacing up to 20% of coal with biomass.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plants breathe carbon dioxide like people breathe oxygen. The carbon dioxide emitted when burning biomass is simply reabsorbed during the next crop growth.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE and General Biofuels are in discussions with several European utilities for long-term offtake agreements.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The attitudes of electric utilities in the United Kingdom towards biomass are similar to those expressed by Drax plc Chief executive Ms. Dorothy Thompson in an article in the Yorkshire Post Leeds on May 26, 2011. Drax produces about 7% of the electricity in the United Kingdom using 90% coal and 10% biomass. Ms. Thompson said: &quot;Biomass has significant potential to deliver an attractive renewable electricity to meet the Government&#39;s ambitious targets for 2020 and beyond. It&#39;s low carbon, low cost and low risk...Our ambition is, if the correct support is put in through the current (government) review, that within five to seven years we will predominantly be a biomass-fired power station&quot;...She wants Drax to &quot;change from being one of the largest carbon emitters in western Europe in terms of a single facility to become one of the largest renewable plants in the world; we would see that as a real achievement.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Ms. Thompson said the case for biomass is &quot;compelling&quot;, particularly at facilities like Drax, which were built for coal-fired electricity generation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The European pellet market was discussed by John Keppler, CEO ENVIVA in a presentation at the International Biomass Conference on May 3, 2011. In 2009, the European pellet market was 10 million tons per year and is expected to reach 30-60 million tons by 2016. This represents a $5-$10 billion a year market based on today&#39;s pellet prices of $170 US per ton. Currently the European pellet market is almost all sawdust and wood waste pellets, primarily from Scandinavia.<span>&nbsp; </span>By 2016, the pellet production shortfall in Europe is expected to exceed 15 million tons per year and these pellets will be imported from the Caribbean, the Americas and Africa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated: &quot;The extremely high yield of Giant King Grass leads to low pellet production costs, and ocean shipping from the Dominican Republic to Europe is manageable. Overall, we expect that we will be able to deliver sustainably grown Giant King Grass energy pellets at a lower cost than the wood waste pellets that are being purchased today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because Giant King Grass can be harvested 6 &frac12; months after planting, we can rapidly serve the pellet marketplace.<span>&nbsp; </span>A new planting of trees takes between 4 and 20 years to harvest so the speed of growth and high yield of Giant King Grass are major competitive advantages.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

(1347, 'VIASPACE CEO PROVIDES BUSINESS UPDATE IN LIVE INTERVIEW ON CHARTPOPPERS.COM', '', '<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Irvine, California, USA-August 30, 2011-VIASPACE Inc. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt">(OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC) and its subsidiary VIASPACE Green Energy Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: VGREF) announced that CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen provided a public business update during an audio interview which is available at <span style="color: black"><a href="http://chartpoppers.com/ireports/chartpopperscom-interviews-dr-carl-kukkonen-ceo-viaspace-inc-otcbbvspc">http://chartpoppers.com/ireports/chartpopperscom-interviews-dr-carl-kukkonen-ceo-viaspace-inc-otcbbvspc</a>. </span><span>&nbsp;</span>ChartPoppers.com is a small-cap research and investment commentary provider. The interview is summarized below and is available with the username: guest and password: 1q2w3e.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 1: For the sake of our new listeners can you briefly describe your business?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen: VIASPACE is a clean energy company that grows Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass as a dedicated energy crop. Giant King Grass is not a food but rather grown specifically as a multipurpose fuel and feedstock for bioenergy and biochemical applications. It can be used as a renewable alternative to coal and nuclear power to generate electricity, and as an alternative to oil to produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Giant King Grass can also be used as a feedstock to make biochemicals and bio plastics.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass has the highest yield in terms of tons per acre of any crop on Earth. That means that you get more electricity or biofuels per acre than with any other crop. Higher crop yield means lower cost electricity or biofuel for producers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our extremely high yield is a major advantage of Giant King Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>Another major advantage is that Giant King Grass has an extensive base of independent test data for bioenergy applications such as electricity generation, pellets, biogas and biofuels. It is perhaps the most well characterized energy crop in the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>This data gives our customers confidence about the content of Giant King Grass and its high yield.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">By teaming up with VIASPACE and growing Giant King Grass, an electric power plant or bio refinery has a captive source of clean fuel and does not have to depend on dirty coal or expensive oil.<span>&nbsp; </span>The VIASPACE business model is to form joint ventures with quality partners worldwide and to produce electricity, pellets, biofuels, biochemicals or bio plastics from Giant King Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>A co-located Giant King Grass plantation and power plant, pellet mill or bio refinery provides jobs for local farmers, higher paying jobs in the power plant, and clean electricity and green products such as Giant King Grass pellets for regional development or export.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Solar is another renewable energy source, but only produces electricity in the daytime. Wind only produces electricity on windy days. We don&#39;t know how to store this electricity, and the world needs electricity that can be produced 24 hours a day all year long. Today, reliable base electricity is produced by coal, gas, oil and nuclear. Giant King Grass replaces these with a clean and renewable alternative.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">To put things in business perspective, coal worldwide is a $300 billion business.<span>&nbsp; </span>Replacing only 1% of coal with Giant King Grass would result in revenues of $3 billion per year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 2: Korea seems to be taking a big interest in your pellets, do you see them as a potential customer?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen:<span>&nbsp; </span>Energy pellets are already a big market in Europe and markets and a developing market in Korea, China and Japan. A pellet is simply Giant King Grass that has been dried, ground into a powder and squeezed into a cylinder that is about three quarters of an inch long and one quarter of an inch wide. Pellets are made by densifying the grass for long-distance bulk shipment in the hold of the ship in a manner like grain is shipped today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The big customers for pellets are large coal-fired electric power plants. They have billions of dollars invested in these power plants and cannot abandon this capital investment. However, many of them are required by government policy to reduce their carbon emissions. So they are taking out up to 20% of the coal and replacing it with biomass pellets and therefore reduce their carbon emissions by 20%.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please remember that plants breathe carbon dioxide and store it during their growth. When you burn biomass, you are simply recycling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not creating new carbon emissions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Europe is fully committed to cofiring biomass with coal and Korea has passed a new energy law that takes effect in 2012. The Korean pellet market is expected to develop quickly. Japan is looking for alternatives to nuclear power, and China is banning coal in small boilers and an internal Chinese market for pellets is emerging.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are working on projects to deliver Giant King Grass energy pellets to these Asian markets.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 3.<span>&nbsp; </span>You were telling me you&#39;ve spent the last month or so, on the road in China, India, Singapore and Thailand promoting your product. What occurred on that trip?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen:<span>&nbsp; </span>I was in China to bring potential customers and partners to our Giant King Grass plantation. Potential customers want to see it for themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was an extremely busy week showing the plantation to representatives for potential projects in China, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, India and Africa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Thailand</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"> is aggressively pursuing biomass to provide clean heat and steam for industry, and to generate electricity. Currently they use agricultural waste as fuel, and there is intense competition for this waste which has driven up the price. Furthermore agricultural waste is seasonal and not available all year long. It is now almost impossible for biomass energy projects in Thailand to obtain financing unless they have a long-term contract in place for the fuel feedstock. Agricultural waste today is entirely a spot market with no long-term contracts. That is why there is significant interest in Giant King Grass as a low-cost dedicated energy crop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I met with several potential customers in Thailand. They recently had an election and have a stable government that is actively trying to promote jobs for farmers and rural development. Biomass power plants fit into this plan, and the national grid will purchase biomass power at a premium over coal. This incentive makes biomass power very attractive in Thailand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In Singapore, I met with companies with plans for bio refineries, power plants and pellet mills in neighboring countries such as Indonesia and New Guinea, and also in Africa. One plan is to grow Giant King Grass nearby and send it by barge to a power plant in Singapore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">India</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"> has 300 or so biomass power plants already operating. These plants run on agriculture and wood waste. There is such a scarcity of fuel that many of these plants are shut down or running at partial capacity. Giant King Grass as a dedicated energy crop has tremendous potential in India.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 4. <span>&nbsp;</span>I was&nbsp;reading with interest your meeting with Simon Parker of DP Clean Tech, how did that go?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen:<span>&nbsp; </span>DP Clean Tech is a leading builder of biomass electricity power plants in China and Europe. They have built 20 biomass power plants in China in the last seven years and built 10 biomass power plants in Europe. DP Clean Tech is now majority owned by Citigroup, and Simon Parker is their CEO.<span>&nbsp; </span>I met Simon in Singapore about three months ago and I met at their office in Thailand last month during my recent trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>DP Clean Tech is working to expand beyond China, and we are looking at opportunities where we can work together. DP Clean Tech fully recognizes that fuel supply is the major issue with biomass power plants. They have tested Giant King Grass and found that it can be used directly in their power plants without modification.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I receive many inquiries from potential customers that want to build a power plant using Giant King Grass. I refer them to DP Clean Tech as a potential source of the power plant. Similarly, some of their power plant prospects are looking for dedicated energy crops. Since they have tested Giant King Grass, they refer these potential customers to us.<span>&nbsp; </span>We hope to have a joint project with both of our technologies in the near future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers<strong> </strong>Question 5.<strong> </strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt">You have a plantation in China and are developing another in the Dominican Republic. The question I have is, &quot;will you be able to meet the&nbsp;demand and do you have plans to expand?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Our plantation in China is mainly for demonstration of Giant King Grass on a small commercial scale. It is 270 acres. It is also a nursery and will provide seedlings for larger energy projects such as our proposed 10,000 acre plantation and pellet mill in Dominican Republic. We are also in discussions for several other plantations with power plants or pellet mills in Southeast Asia, India, Africa and China.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We have all of the infrastructure we need for expansion. Now we need to turn these prospective projects into reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 6<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Last week I got excited to see your 2nd Quarterly results. 269% revenue increase in comparison to the same period last year.&nbsp;Congratulations! How do you see things progressing for&nbsp;the rest of the year?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are very pleased about the second quarter. The third-quarter also looks good. We are quite optimistic and we are reinvesting the profits and cash flows into expanding the Giant King Grass business.<span>&nbsp; </span>We just hired a new Chief Business Officer to close bioenergy projects.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 7<strong>. </strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt">I believe you are traveling back to Korea next month for a conference, will you be speaking? <span>&nbsp;</span>What&#39;s the subject?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I will be speaking at two conferences in the next month and conducting a tour of the plantation for a potential customer in between. The Pellets Trade Asia conference will be held in Seoul Korea September 7-8. This conference is focusing on supply and demand for pellets in Asia. The demand is mostly in Korea and Japan, but they do not have enough biomass in their countries. So the plan is to grow biomass such as Giant King Grass in southern Asia, make pellets and then ship pellets in bulk to customers in northern Asia.<span>&nbsp; </span>My talk will compare the pluses and minuses of agricultural pellets such as Giant King Grass with wood pellets that dominate the marketplace today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is good to get invited to speak at conferences, because we can increase awareness of Giant King Grass plus these conferences are convenient places to meet with existing and new contacts. I have already scheduled meetings around the conference in Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">On September 14 - 16, I am speaking at the Bio Refining conference in Houston Texas. This is a conference focused on using biomass to make liquid biofuels, biochemicals and bio plastics. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">ChartPoppers Question 8<strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span></strong>How do you see the future unfolding for the company?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The future for Giant King Grass and other biomass is very bright. It provides clean and renewable electricity and biofuels.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In a developing country, a Giant King Grass plantation provides jobs for their farmers. A power plant or pellet mill also provides good paying jobs.<span>&nbsp; </span>The resulting electricity is clean and provides the ability for economic development.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 30 MW power plant can provide electricity for up to 250,000 families in rural China or India.<span>&nbsp; </span>The country does not have to spend its currency to buy foreign coal or oil and can have economic development for its population.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The developed world is a good market for Giant King Grass pellets and for biofuels using Giant King Grass as a nonfood feedstock. The world is beginning to restrict or ban the use of food crops for fuel. This tendency will benefit Giant King Grass.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is now a growing, development stage company with thousands of small shareholders. We have many business opportunities and are focused on increasing shareholder value which I believe will happen when we announce the start of our first bioenergy project. Our main advantage is the extremely high yield of Giant King Grass which makes it the most cost effective feedstock in the biomass industry. Our VIASPACE business model is scalable. A plantation and power plant or pellet mill can be replicated hundreds of times throughout the world.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE </span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VGREF), today announced that <span style="color: black">its CEO Carl Kukkonen has conducted an exclusive new audio-taped webcast interview so that shareholders and the investment community can learn more about the Company&#39;s recently developments and its growth plans.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unrestricted access to the webcast is now available on the &quot;Webcasts&quot; page at <a href="http://www.thegreenbaron.com/Webcasts.htm">http://www.thegreenbaron.com/Webcasts.htm</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Investors who wish to receive The Green Baron Report for free can join at <a href="http://www.thegreenbaron.com/Join.htm">http://www.thegreenbaron.com/Join.htm</a>.</span></span> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Green Baron Report issued an updated &quot;Stock Pick&quot; profile on VIASPACE Inc. dated Monday, November 7, 2011 to its members that is available on their website. The report focused on news about VIASPACE&#39;s proprietary Giant King Grass being used to fuel a proposed 90 MW biomass power plant project in Thailand.<span>&nbsp; </span>The landmark agreement for VIASPACE would support the largest biomass power project being developed in Asia.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The interview is summarized below.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><strong></strong></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question: Please give us a brief overview of the history of VIASPACE.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE was founded in 1998 and became public in 2005. Originally the company focused on products that were licensed from the Caltech NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The original technologies came via the space program-- that is how the company got its name VIASPACE. From 1984 until 1998 I was director of a research center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is now focused on renewable energy, in particular we focus on biomass energy which is energy derived from living things like plants.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question: I understand that VIASPACE has a proprietary dedicated energy crop called Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass which you grow as a low-carbon fuel for electricity generating power plants, and as a feedstock for making energy pellets and cellulosic biofuels such as ethanol and butanol.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please explain the characteristics of Giant King Grass in more detail and why it has such great potential as an energy crop.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">First it is important to understand how biomass is used for energy today, and why a dedicated energy crop is needed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The oldest use of biomass is to simply burn biomass such as wood to produce heat for your home business. The heat can also be used to boil water to make steam which produces electricity.<span>&nbsp; </span>In these applications, biomass replaces coal, oil or natural gas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Biomass such as corn or sugarcane can be distilled into alcohol called ethanol which is an automotive fuel replacing gasoline. Corn and sugarcane can also be used to make biochemicals and bio plastics which are currently made from oil.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">There are two major advantages of using biomass. First biomass is renewable. New plants can be grown to replace the plants used for energy. Second, using biomass puts much less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere compared to using coal, oil or natural gas. This is because plants breathe carbon dioxide and store it in their tissue. When you burn biomass, you are simply recycling the carbon dioxide absorbed originally by the plant. Biomass is carbon neutral.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">So if biomass is renewable and carbon neutral, why don&#39;t we use it routinely for energy today? </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">There are three main reasons.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">First, corn and sugarcane are food crops and the world does not want trade off food supplies for fuel.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Second, wood is needed for construction and furniture, and there is not enough wood in the world today for energy. People don&#39;t want the rain forest cut down just to supply energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Finally, the primary sources of biomass for energy today are byproducts of forestry and agriculture such as sawdust, and corn straw--which is the rest of the corn plant after the corn is harvested. These waste products are in limited supply which has caused their price to rise dramatically.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Dedicated energy crops such as our Giant King Grass can solve these problems of biomass. Giant King Grass is the highest yielding crop in the world. It is not a food crop and it can be grown on marginal land which is not used for food. Giant King Grass has been extensively tested by many companies and shown to be suitable for electricity generation and biofuels. Its high yield in terms of tons per acre means that Giant King Grass is the lowest cost feedstock and this means that the electricity and biofuels can be produced profitably.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We believe that VIASPACE Giant King Grass will be the fuel and feedstock of choice for many bioenergy applications. We are working closely with companies that produce power plants and bio conversion facilities to develop projects that integrate a Giant King Grass plantation with a power plant, energy pellet mill or bio refinery.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE has a scalable and sustainable business model.<span>&nbsp; </span>A Giant King Grass plantation and power plant can be reproduced hundreds of times throughout the world. The plantation provides jobs for farmers. The power plant provides good paying jobs and the money stays inside the country rather than going to pay for imported oil or coal. The resulting electricity is clean and provides energy for local industry and development.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question: On Monday, November 7, 2011, it was announced that VIASPACE signed an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with Seema Energy Co., Ltd. to jointly plan a Giant King Grass plantation to fuel Seema&#39;s proposed 90 Megawatt biomass power plant.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the release, you stated, &quot;This is a landmark agreement for VIASPACE to support the largest biomass power project being developed in Asia.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Please explain this agreement and its potential in terms of revenues and profits in the future.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The proposed Seema power plant is in Thailand which is the perfect climate for growing Giant King Grass. The new government elected this year is working aggressively to find alternatives for their planned nuclear power plants after the Japanese nuclear disaster.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Seema is planning to use 100% Giant King Grass in their power plant complex which will be built out as three co-located 30 MW power plants for a total of 90 MW. The companion Giant King Grass plantation will produce the more than 900,000 tons of Giant King Grass each year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I was in Thailand last week to meet with Seema and with other potential customers. I believe that Thailand will be an important market for VIASPACE.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Seema project is extremely important because it will be not only be the largest biomass power plant in Asia, it will be the first power plant to use a dedicated energy crop rather than agricultural waste as its fuel. It is the perfect example of our business model which is to have an integrated plantation and power plant that are co-located. Water and sunshine come in and electricity goes out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Seema project will be one of the first commercial applications of Giant King Grass on a large scale. The plantation will be up to 20,000 acres in size.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The proposed project will produce significant revenue and profit for VIASPACE, and it will be a model for replication throughout Thailand and the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Seema and VIASPACE have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the plantation. Seema has also signed a contract for a 5 acre test plot of Giant King Grass in Thailand. We have received the first payment on this contract.<span>&nbsp; </span>While I was in Thailand with our VIASPACE agronomist, we looked at land for the Seema test plot, and we planted a small amount of Giant King Grass. The full 5 acres should be planted in January. The purpose of the test plot is to demonstrate Giant King Grass growing in Thailand, and to do scientific studies for optimal growth including requirements for irrigation and fertilizer. I expect to be back in Thailand in January.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question: Tell us about other projects that have large potential you are working on for use of Giant King Grass.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We have a joint venture to develop an integrated Giant King Grass plantation and pellet mill in the Dominican Republic to produce energy pellets for export to coal-fired power plants in Europe. The pellets have been tested and we are negotiating a contract with a large European utility.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are also working on a pellet mill project in Southeast Asia and potential power plants in Central and South America.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Most of our discussions are covered by confidentiality agreements, and we will release information when it is okayed by our partners.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question: Your quarterly earnings report was recently announced on Tuesday, November 15 and showed that VIASPACE generated $2.17 million in revenues, an increase of 138% from the prior year, and gross profit increased 199% from the previous year.<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you attribute these stronger results?</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The profits are generated from our Inter-Pacific Arts division that produces framed art for US retailers. As the economy in the US improves, consumers are purchasing our quality framed art to decorate their homes and apartments. We are on track for a very good year. Revenue for the first three quarters was a little above $5.5 million which is a 114% increase over last year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We have been working hard to keep costs down and to produce the highest quality product for our existing customers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The framed art business is very important to VIASPACE. We are fully committed to it and we expect that we can expand the business in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">However, our focus for long-term growth is the renewable energy business based on Giant King Grass. We have been reinvesting the profits and cash flow into improving our framed art factory, and most importantly to build the Giant King Grass-based energy business, which we believe will be the major revenue and profit generator in the future.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question: At what point in the future do you believe VIASPACE will go profitable on a net basis and what stock price do you believe the Company should be valued at once that occurs?</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The framed art business is profitable already and generating cash for us to reinvest into the grass business. When we begin to record significant revenue from the Giant King Grass business, VIASPACE itself will be profitable. We believe that when we have a contract for the first power plant or pellet mill, the investment community will pay a lot of attention to VIASPACE. The stock market determines our valuation; I cannot do that, although I believe our potential for growth is not factored into our current stock price. &nbsp;When we record significant revenues from our Giant King Grass business our shareholders should be rewarded. </span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: Finally, what else would you like to tell an investor that might be considering a purchase of VSPC common stock?</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I would first tell the investor that all penny stocks are not created equal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research the company.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do they have a real business? &nbsp;Are they making presentations and attending conferences? &nbsp;&nbsp;Do they have potential contracts and are they updating shareholders with press releases? &nbsp;&nbsp;You need to be careful in investing in penny stocks and don&#39;t put your life savings into any penny stock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE has been in business for 13 years and we have been public for six years. We are fully reporting to the SEC, and fully audited. We are an honest company, and we communicate regularly with our shareholders.&nbsp; We believe that our Giant King Grass will be an important fuel and feedstock for the future. The very high yield and low cost of Giant King Grass should make it the biomass source of choice for many applications.&nbsp; Our entire team is working hard to make the company successful.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE is a clean energy company providing products and technology for renewable and alternative energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-pollutant energy sources.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VGREF), today announced that <span style="color: black">an invited presentation on Giant King Grass made by CEO Carl Kukkonen at the 11th International Conference on Clean Energy held in Taiwan November 2-5, 2011 is now available at the VIASPACE website <a href="..//">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>. The presentation &quot;Perennial Grass as a Dedicated Energy Crop&quot; was co-authored by VIASPACE Green Energy President Sung Chang who also attended the conference.

In your recent press release entitled &quot;Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass targeted as fuel for planned 90 mw biomass power plant in Thailand&quot;, you stated &quot;This is a landmark agreement for VIASPACE&quot;, please tell us about this agreement and what it means to VIASPACE?</span></em></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Our customer, Seema Energy, is planning to build the largest biomass power plant in Asia. It consists of three 30 MW power plants built in the center of a Giant King Grass plantation. This would be not only the largest biomass power plant, but it would be the first to use a dedicated energy crop as its fuel.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Other smaller biomass power plants have been built in Thailand, but they use agricultural waste such as rice straw or rice husks as the fuel.<span>&nbsp; </span>The disadvantages of using rice waste are that it is only available after the rice has been harvested and the price varies dramatically with season.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are no long-term contracts for agricultural waste which is only available on the spot market, and the price has been rising. Because of these problems, many of the biomass power plants in Thailand are operating at only partial capacity and are losing money. Banks are now insisting that any new biomass power plants must have a long-term fuel supply agreement in place before they will finance the project. Giant King Grass is a dedicated energy crop and solves this fuel supply problem.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The power plant in Thailand will grow its own Giant King Grass to use as its fuel. Seema initially looked at growing trees as fuel, but rejected that option because the trees took too long to grow and the yield per acre was too low. Giant King Grass has the highest yield of any plant in the world and it can be harvested twice a year with the first harvest 6 1/2 months after planting.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass is a perennial crop. You cut it at 14 feet tall, and 4 to 6 months later it is 14 feet tall again and ready to cut.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Thailand</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"> has the perfect climate for growing Giant King Grass. The new government in Thailand is strongly supporting the agricultural sector and the Giant King Grass plantation is expected to provide more than 2000 jobs.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">This project is very important to VIASPACE. It will be one of the first large scale commercial energy applications of Giant King Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>This Thailand model for a power plant co-located with a Giant King Grass plantation can be replicated many times in Thailand and throughout the world.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">2. The first step then is a test plot in Thailand, can you give us a time line on that and how confident are you of the results?</span></em></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">During my trip to Thailand, our VIASPACE agricultural expert and I evaluated several candidate sites for the test plot and we took soil samples. We planted a little Giant King Grass while we were there, and we expect that the five-acre test plot will be planted in January.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Based on the climate, soil and the potential for irrigation, we are 99% certain that the test plot will be successful. The objective of the test plot is to demonstrate the growth of Giant King Grass on their land in Thailand, and more importantly to determine optimum plant spacing, fertilizer and irrigation requirements for production. The test plot will also serve as a propagation nursery to provide seedlings for the large plantation needed for the power plant. </span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">3. The plant will require 930,000 tonnes of Giant King Grass per year, if my sums are right that will require 9,000 hectares (22,500 acres). That&#39;s a lot of land, can you tell&nbsp;us your plans in this regard?</span></em></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The customer is being very conservative and has more land than we believe will be needed. We expect that they will be able to provide all of the required Giant King Grass with 20% less land. This is still a very large farm, but it is only the size of a square 5 miles on each side. The power plant will provide clean electricity for 380,000 households in Thailand. The high yield of Giant King Grass enables a project of this size to be done on a piece of land that small, and because land costs are so expensive, the high yield is crucial in keeping the fuel and electricity costs down.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE will be working closely with our partner in Thailand to make sure that the plantation is in full operation before the power plant is completed.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">4. When do you hope to be in full operation?</span></em></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The power plant takes two years to build. We would begin establishing the Giant King Grass plantation immediately after the power plant contract is signed.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">5.<span>&nbsp; </span>You mentioned earlier that the Thailand government is strongly supporting agriculture, you anticipate creating 2,000 jobs. Do you expect to gain financial support from the government in Thailand? </span></em></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Thailand</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"> had ambitious plans for nuclear electricity that were scrapped after the Japanese nuclear disaster. The government is working hard to find alternatives to provide the needed electricity. Coal-fired power plants are very unpopular with the local people, so the options are limited. Natural gas is being aggressively pursued.<span>&nbsp; </span>Biomass electricity is very attractive because Thailand is a large agricultural country and biomass electricity is much cheaper than solar. In addition biomass provides jobs for farmers who represent a large base of support for the new government.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We don&#39;t expect to receive direct support for the project from the Thai government. However we do expect that the government will increase the price they will pay for biomass electricity supplied to the national grid, and this will make the Seema project profitable and financeable.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">6. Last week I read over your quarterly financial report, can summarize it for us?</span></em></strong></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">So far 2011 is a very good year. Our revenues through the first three quarters are over $5 million--which is 114% higher than for the same period in 2010.<span>&nbsp; </span>The revenues come from our profitable framed art division. We manufacture high-quality custom framed art and sell it to retailers in the US. Business for these retailers has picked up considerably and our results reflect this.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE re-invests these profits to expand and develop our Giant King Grass bioenergy business which we expect will be the source of large growth in the future. The framed art business has allowed VIASPACE to survive the economic downturn without having to raise capital through a stock offering which would have diluted our existing shareholders. This source of income is a major strategic advantage for VIASPACE, well-positioned to exploit the developing markets for biomass electricity and biofuels.</span></p><p style="background: white; margin-right: -31.5pt"><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">7.

I&#39;m particularly pleased to be able to share the interview with Dr. Kevin Schewe, the new VIASPACE board member. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">As to my background, I am trained as a theoretical physicist with a PhD from Cornell University. I worked at Ford Motor Company in Dearborn Michigan where I initially did physics research and then moved into alternative energy. I was Ford&#39;s expert on hydrogen as an alternative automotive fuel and I led a team to design and develop a new direct injection diesel engine.<span>&nbsp; </span>I then worked for 14 years at the NASA Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California where I directed a research center in electronics and computing technology. In 1998, the president of Caltech said that he wanted to commercialize more technology from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and I left my secured job to form a startup company. Originally we were focused on commercializing technologies licensed from NASA and the products came via the space program. This is how we got the company name VIASPACE. Now VIASPACE focuses on biomass energy using our proprietary high yield energy crop Giant King Grass-- which has nothing to do with the space program.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Now I&#39;d like to introduce Dr. Kevin Schewe who is a renowned cancer specialist and entrepreneur from Denver, Colorado. He is also one of VIASPACE&#39;s largest shareholders. He was appointed to the board of directors at our meeting on January 19.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I am a Medical Doctor and a Board-Certified Radiation Oncologist in my 25th year of private practice of Oncology. I am the Medical Director of a beautiful, new radiation oncology department at the Red Rocks Medical Center in Golden, Colorado and also the Thornton Cancer Center in Thornton, Colorado. I&nbsp;designed and&nbsp;co-own these two facilities in partnership with HealthONE, the Colorado Division of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) ---the largest private operator of healthcare facilities in the world. I am an entrepreneur and have developed a premium line of skin care products called Elite Therapeutics. These products help to naturally heal, protect, repair, and subsequently maintain the damaged skin of cancer patients who have received&nbsp;radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Since they can help this extent of skin damage, they can also help anyone with skin damage from aging, dryness, UV exposure, other illnesses or environmental causes. Later this spring, Elite Therapeutics will become the exclusive&nbsp;in-room amenity provider for the world famous Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Our website address is <a href="http://www.elitetherapeutics.com/">http://www.elitetherapeutics.com/</a></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl - Before our focus turns to the press release issued on January 24, please provide us an overview of VIASPACE and discuss your most important developments going on now.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE focuses on bioenergy and biofuels. We have a proprietary dedicated energy crop called Giant King Grass that can be used to generate clean renewable electricity, produce liquid biofuels, biochemicals and bio plastics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass has the highest yield per acre of any crop in the world and this makes it the lowest cost feedstock. Giant King Grass has been tested by many companies and independent laboratories. It is an extremely well-characterized and dependable fuel and feedstock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">In order to get an energy project financed by equity investors or lenders, the project must have a long-term secure fuel supply agreement. Lenders and investors will not finance a biomass project that does not have a guaranteed source of fuel. Giant King Grass gives projects both fuel security and a low feedstock price.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Over the last three years we have invested over $3 million to develop Giant King Grass and to demonstrate it in a pilot plantation and a pilot processing facility. Many potential customers and strategic partners have visited our plantation and processing facility. Giant King Grass is now widely recognized as an attractive energy crop, and customers are coming to us.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass is not a food crop, is sustainably grown and carbon neutral. Because of its high yield, Giant King Grass can meet the price targets for the fuel or feedstock for all bioenergy projects.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I am joining the interview today from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where I am meeting with a potential joint venture partner. This partner visited us and has seen Giant King Grass and is looking to develop a power project in Malaysia.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Then I go on to Thailand where we are working with Seema Energy which is developing a 90 MW biomass power plant complex based entirely on Giant King Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>This would be the largest biomass energy plant in Asia and the first one to use a dedicated energy crop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are also working with a partner to develop a Giant King Grass plantation and pellet mill in the Dominican Republic. The pellets would be shipped in bulk in ocean freighters to an electric utility in Europe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are working with partners on other potential bioenergy projects in the Philippines, Indonesia,<span>&nbsp; </span>Central and South America, and Africa.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Last week on January 24, it was announced that VIASPACE appointed you, Dr. Kevin Schewe, to the Board of Directors.<span>&nbsp; </span>It also notes that you are a large shareholder of VSPC common stock having acquired 77 million common shares with a goal to acquire another 53 million shares.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is clear through your purchases that you have positive conviction in the future of VIASPACE and believe your investment will grow over time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please explain how you were originally introduced to VIASPACE and why you believe this is going to be a profitable stock investment for your portfolio.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I have a separate portfolio for microcap and smallcap stocks and enjoy investing in smaller companies that have a reasonable probability of&nbsp;future success and therefore significant&nbsp;appreciation and return on investment. I particularly have focused on&nbsp;companies related to technology, energy and biotech. I&nbsp;originally discovered&nbsp;VIASPACE about three years ago and subsequently made a small investment in VSPC common stock. Once the investment actually becomes&nbsp;a part of my portfolio, I then watch it every day and research the company&#39;s activities more rigorously. The VIASPACE focus of bioenergy and biofuels with the proprietary dedicated energy crop of Giant King Grass that caught my attention in a big way! I started to research the renewable energy sector and realized that we, VIASPACE, are on&nbsp;the leading edge of what should become a major component of&nbsp;the future of renewable energy. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass may be the most &quot;perfect&quot; energy crop on the planet. It has the highest yield per acre and therefore the lowest cost feedstock.&nbsp;It grows best in a bandwidth of twenty degrees north or south of the equator where in can be harvested up to three times per year. A Giant King Grass plantation can be co-located with a power plant to generate local electricity; a pellet mill to produce an energy commodity that&nbsp;can be shipped anywhere in the world for bioenergy consumption or co-located with a biofuel, biochemical or bioplastics manufacturing facility. Wow, the possibilities are mind-boggling and it is our job at VIASPACE to introduce this amazing renewable energy source to the world. The term &quot;peak oil&#39;&#39; is used a lot in the current hydrocarbon universe, we have an ideal and perfectly green solution to supplement the world&#39;s energy needs with Giant King Grass. I believe this is a once in a generation opportunity to invest in a small company with gigantic upside potential and I, for one, am putting my personal money where my conviction is.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl - Please explain the reasons you wanted Dr. Schewe to join the Board of Directors, and do you plan to add more members to the Board over the next year?</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe contacted me over a year ago, and we ended up communicating by e-mail and then by telephone. It was clear to me that Dr. Schewe shared our vision and was putting his money where his mouth was. He also has experience as an entrepreneur-- having started a skincare products company called Elite Therapeutics. Dr. Schewe represented to me an ideal shareholder. He understands the company and its goals and clearly sees the potential for rapid growth after we complete our first successful project.<span>&nbsp; </span>He takes a long-term view and is interested in increasing shareholder value. He is not looking for a 20% increase in the value of his holdings. He is looking for a 100 times increase which he believes is possible if we can execute on our plans. Dr. Schewe is already helping.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">We have five board members now. Three of them are from outside the company and they provide a lot of strategic guidance to management. We don&#39;t have a specific plan to add additional members at this time.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Kevin - What else would you like to tell an investor that might be considering a purchase of VSPC stock?</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I am a medical doctor and board-certified radiation oncologist in my 25th year of private practice. I choose to pick my own investments rather than having someone else do that for me. Through the years, I have invested in numerous biotech companies: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical services, etc... I have invested in early-stage&nbsp;biopharmaceutical&nbsp;companies that have incredibly promising&nbsp;drug technology, but&nbsp;they have to go through very expensive and time-consuming clinical trials&nbsp;and then ultimately face FDA approval. It is common for these early stage biotech companies to have a market cap of $100 million, even though they have no revenue, a significant yearly financial burn rate, and literally years of clinical testing and FDA hurdles out in front of them, not to mention incredibly stiff competition from other pharma companies and the chance that the product won&#39;t work as well in humans as in theory, the lab or animals. If those companies have market caps of $100 million, then VIASPACE should have a similar market cap right here and now, and yet, we have a market cap of $10 million. We have a product, Giant King Grass, which has been independently tested for energy content and it has been successfully pelletized. In the proper climate, it grows like crazy and can be harvested multiple times per year. You just can&#39;t get that kind of performance from trees and wood pellets. We are working to have a renewable energy model that can be replicated over and over again---literally on&nbsp;a global basis! Once that model is proven successful and begins to replicate, then this company&#39;s value&nbsp;takes off faster than Giant King Grass can grow. I did not sign on to&nbsp;work as a&nbsp;Board Member for VIASPACE so this could be a $100 million company, I signed on to make this a billion dollar plus bioenergy&nbsp;company. Energy is big business and we intend to make Giant King Grass the recognized standard in renewable bioenergy crops---the &quot;light sweet crude&quot; of bioenergy. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Since becoming a VIASPACE Board Member, I have purchased an additional 4 million VSPC common shares on the open market and now preferentially hold 81,000,000 common shares.&nbsp;At the current share prices and even well&nbsp;north of a penny per share, I will keep buying. In my opinion, we are significantly under valued. I will do my part to work with Carl, the VIASPACE staff and other Board Members to make this company successful and increase the share value for all shareholders.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl - Same question, what else would you like to tell an investor that might be considering purchase of the stock, or an investor that might already own VSPC at a higher price?</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I always tell investors to do their homework. Look at our website www.VIASPACE.com. We have been public since June 2005. We are fully audited and fully reporting to the SEC. Our SEC filings are available. VIASPACE also communicates regularly with shareholders through press releases and these are available on our website. An investor should always do this type of homework.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I believe that VIASPACE and Giant King Grass are on the verge of being a key partner in successful energy projects.

All of the business opportunities are covered by confidentiality agreements and this limits the amount of detail that can be disclosed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">There are three biomass power plant projects in the Americas that are in the planning stage and would use Giant King Grass as the fuel-a 30 MW power plant in Central America, 30 MW power plant in South America and 20 MW power plant in the Caribbean.<span>&nbsp; </span>The projects are being developed together with local partners in their respective countries. VIASPACE is providing the Giant King Grass energy crop and plantation/growing expertise, and the biomass power plant technology through our strategic partner. VIASPACE is also providing the economic analysis on the financial returns for the projects. The local partners will provide the power purchase agreement, the land and operations for the plantation. Another biomass power plant project in southern Europe is also considering Giant King Grass as the fuel. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;We are playing a project development role as well as the energy crop provider&quot;, stated Kukkonen.<span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;We are gratified by the strong interest in biomass power plants fueled by Giant King Grass. Our economic analysis demonstrates that the high yield of Giant King Grass leads to significantly lower fuel cost--compared to other alternatives --which is the key to the financial success of these power plants. Fuel costs are the largest operating cost for the power plant.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass pellets were recently provided to a large European utility for analysis, and to a European trading company as samples for potential customers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The results of the utility analysis were shared with us, and discussions are proceeding with the utility which has expressed interest in both purchasing pellets and potentially investing in a plantation/pellet mill project.

On the pellet side --China has restricted the use of coal in small boilers and this has led to a new Chinese domestic demand for pellets. Additionally, a new law in Korea requires the use of biomass for electricity generation and this is leading to a market for pellets. Korean utilities and fuel traders are actively seeking sources of biomass pellets, and are co-investing in pellet projects. Southern China and Southeast Asia have ideal climates to grow Giant King Grass, and the transportation distances to customers in Asia are much shorter than distances to customers in Europe. This leads to very favorable economics for pellet projects. European pellet buyers are also active in soliciting pellet supply from Southeast Asia.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE is pursuing several pellet opportunities in Asia.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Malaysia</span><span style="font-size: 11pt">, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines are actively promoting biomass power plants for electricity generation through government initiatives and feed in tariffs. A feed in tariff is a commitment from the government electrical grid to purchase biomass electricity at a specific price for a specified period of time. A feed in tariff is essentially a government guarantee to buy the electricity and this guarantee can be used to obtain equity and debt financing for the project. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen traveled to Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar in February where he met with current and potential partners for biomass electric power plants in these countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>Representatives from the Philippines and Malaysia flew to California in December to meet with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>In February, Kukkonen also met with representatives of Seema Energy who are developing a 90 MW biomass power plant in Thailand to be fueled by Giant King Grass.

A portion of that profit remains in the VIASPACE Green Energy bank account. VIASPACE proposed that part of the $710,000 in the VIASPACE Green Energy bank account on March 31, 2012 be used to partially make the note payment to Chang and defer the remaining amount.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chang rejected this proposal.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">On May 15, 2012, Chang informed VIASPACE that his family members and investor friends in Taiwan told him that VIASPACE Green Energy should no longer provide any financial support to VIASPACE for the Giant King Grass business, and that VIASPACE Green Energy should retain the profits from the sales of framed art to Hobby Lobby and the future profits from the pellet mill in China. Chang also requested a proposal for a separation of VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy into two companies, the terms of which included having VIASPACE turn over to Chang the VIASPACE Green Energy shares owned by VIASPACE and pledged as security for the note.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As requested, VIASPACE drafted a proposal for a separation of VIASPACE&#39;s ownership of VGE that allowed VIASPACE to continue in the Giant King Grass business, and director Dr. Kevin Schewe and VIASPACE management agreed to fund VIASPACE&#39;s continuing operations from a combination of investment by Schewe and salary reductions by CEO Carl Kukkonen and CFO Stephen Muzi. That proposal was rejected by Chang. The VIASPACE board met on May 21, 2012 (Chang did not attend this meeting) to consider a new request from Chang to formulate a new proposal that kept VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy together as they are now, but not to use any of the VIASPACE Green Energy funds for VIASPACE activities. VIASPACE presented such a proposal to Chang whereby VIASPACE was to be funded by Schewe and management. The VIASPACE board stated that both the &quot;separation&quot; proposal and the &quot;stay together&quot; proposal were acceptable to the VIASPACE board. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Chang did not accept either the separation proposal or the stay together proposal that were both acceptable to the VIASPACE board. <span>&nbsp;</span>After a discussion of his fiduciary responsibility to all VIASPACE (VSPC) shareholders as the director of a publicly traded company, Sung Chang resigned as a board member of VIASPACE effective May 24, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>On May 28, 2012, the board of VIASPACE met again to discuss the negotiations with Chang including a counter-proposal from Chang that was received on May 25, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>They discussed additional attempts to strike an agreement with Chang.<span>&nbsp; </span>They submitted changes to the counter-proposal on May 30, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>On May 31, 2012, Chang rejected most of VIASPACE&#39;s comments.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE sent both a revised separation proposal and a new simplified stay together proposal to Chang on June 2, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chang rejected both proposals on June 5, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>On June 7, 2012, Chang submitted another version of his counter-proposal, characterized as his final offer to VIASPACE, which was rejected by the VIASPACE board on June 8, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>Negotiations are now at an impasse.<span>&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, VIASPACE did not make the payment due to Chang on May 14, 2012 and, upon formal notice, will have defaulted on the Chang note.<span>&nbsp; </span>As part of the acquisition in 2008, VIASPACE had issued a stock power assigning the VIASPACE Green Energy shares owned by VIASPACE to Chang.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE owns 6,503,920 VGREF shares which are currently being held by Chang as security for the note.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These shares are 75.6% of the 8,600,000 total outstanding shares of VIASPACE Green Energy and now belong to Chang.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chang is the majority shareholder of VIASPACE Green Energy (VGREF).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The market value of these shares is $14,633,820 and the appropriate Form 1099 will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Chang and Chang related parties remain the largest shareholder of VIASPACE with </span><span style="font-size: 11pt">424,971,710 shares (30.7<span style="color: black">% of outstanding shares), and Chang retains a preferred share that gives him supermajority (50.1%) voting rights for the common stock.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">After the transfer of VGE shares from VIASPACE to Chang, VIASPACE will no longer own VIASPACE Green Energy which in turn owns Inter-Pacific Arts and the Giant King Grass plantation in China. VIASPACE would then no longer be able to report the revenue or have access to the profits from the framed art business. The Giant King Grass license was paid for by VIASPACE. VIASPACE continues to have a cash obligation of $136,000 owed to CEO Carl Kukkonen for back salary.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE does not have the cash to pay Kukkonen, and he has indicated that he is willing to defer payment as part of an agreement for VIASPACE business continuation.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The VIASPACE Board of Directors is willing to reopen negotiations with Chang, and has the goal to continue its Giant King Grass bioenergy business and preserve and increase VIASPACE shareholder value.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the board has an obligation to inform shareholders that negotiations are at an impasse.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Chang and Chang related parties own 424,971,710 VIASPACE shares, Dr. Kevin Schewe owns 98,000,000 shares, CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen owns 78,802,954 shares and CFO Stephen Muzi owns 31,689,901 shares.<span>&nbsp; </span>These represent 633 million shares, or 45.8% of the outstanding common shares of VIASPACE.<span>&nbsp; </span>The remaining 750 million shares are owned by an estimated 5000+ shareholders.<span>&nbsp; </span>The board has the goal to find a solution to provide value for all VSPC shareholders. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As stated earlier, Chang is unwilling to utilize profits from the framed art business and future profits from the China pellet mill to continue funding VIASPACE any further.<span>&nbsp; </span>Schewe is willing to fund VIASPACE operations if VIASPACE continues to have the exclusive license for Giant King Grass, and in addition, is not willing to do so as long as Chang retains the supermajority preferred share.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are the major issues in the impasse.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;This is a period of uncertainty for VIASPACE. Shareholders need to be informed and this is the reason for this detailed press release. As a cofounder of VIASPACE in 1998, I am sad to see this impasse.

(OTC Bulletin Board: VGREF) today provides the following update to shareholders.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As reported in the joint VIASPACE (VSPC) and VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE) Press Releases dated April 30, 2012 and again on June 11, 2012, the boards of both companies at the joint board meeting held on April 19, 2012, unanimously approved a baseline 2012 budget that utilized the profits from the framed art business division (Inter-Pacific Arts Corp. --IPA) and the future revenues from the sale of pellets from the China Plantation to fund the VIASPACE Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass business. In addition, at the same joint board meeting on April 19, 2012, one year employment contracts for the CEO and CFO were approved. The 2012 budget had all expenses paid in cash with the goal of no additional stock dilution for shareholders. Attending that joint board meeting, and documented in the minutes, were VGE Directors, Sung Chang, Samuel Chen and Carl Kukkonen; and VIASPACE Directors Sung Chang, Carl Kukkonen, Angelina Galiteva and Kevin Schewe. The two boards present at that meeting voted unanimously for these board actions and these votes and actions were recorded in the corporate minutes.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Following the joint board meeting on April 19, 2012 in Denver, Colorado, Mr. Chang traveled to China and Taiwan. When he returned to the U.S., he informed the VIASPACE board that he no longer intended to have Inter-Pacific Arts or VGE provide financial support to VIASPACE for the Giant King Grass business, and that VGE should retain the IPA profits from the sale of framed art and the future profits from the pellet mill in China. Chang also requested a proposal for the separation of VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy into two companies. This surprise change of corporate direction occurred less than a month after Mr. Chang&#39;s vote of support on April 19, 2012 as a Board Director for both VIASPACE and VGE.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mr. Chang subsequently resigned from the VIASPACE Board on May 24, 2012. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE agreed to embark on a series of negotiations with Mr. Chang to separate VIASPACE and VGE which were carefully documented in our June 11, 2012 Press Release, and at the time of that Press Release, we believed we were at an impasse. Within two days of the June 11, 2012 Press Release, negotiations to separate the companies had resumed and those negotiations have continued since then. Mr. Chang has not declared in writing that VIASPACE is in default on the existing note due to him. Carl Kukkonen and Stephen Muzi have not resigned or been terminated and both continue to work as CEO and CFO, respectively, for both VIASPACE and VGE. Their prior employment contracts with VGE expired on May 14, 2012, and new contracts were extended for one year by vote of the VGE Board of Directors on April 19, 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither Dr. Kukkonen nor Mr. Muzi have been paid since May 2012. The VIASPACE Green Energy Board has not had a formal board meeting since April 19, 2012. The VIASPACE Board of Directors has been meeting regularly to review and return proposed term sheets from Mr. Chang&#39;s lawyer.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO, Carl Kukkonen, continues to work with potential customers and clients of VIASPACE who are interested in Giant King Grass and we continue to believe that that VIASPACE can become one of the first successful renewable biomass/bioenergy companies using our significant corporate knowledge and expertise and having Giant King Grass as our scalable bioenergy platform. The VIASPACE Board has given Mr. Chang a potential way forward which addresses his desire not to fund the company any longer through IPA framed art sales or future China pellet sales and simultaneously gives him and all VSPC shareholders a reasonable chance of increasing shareholder value. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The VIASPACE Board returned the last set of term sheets to Mr. Chang and his lawyer on Tuesday, July 3, 2012, with a deadline for them to respond back to us by Friday, July 6, 2012. We have proposed that the term sheets be agreed upon and signed by both parties no later than Tuesday, July 17, 2012 and formal legal documents memorializing the term sheets signed within 45 days thereafter. The VIASPACE Board and management believe that it is in the best interests of the VIASPACE shareholders that these negotiations should be concluded soon. VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;This remains a period of uncertainty for VIASPACE and we are working hard to arrive at a resolution that benefits all VIASPACE shareholders.

I will work closely with Managing Director, Dr. Nu Nu Win, to develop the business opportunities.</span></p><p><span style="color: black">JUNE Managing Director, Dr Nu Nu Win states. &quot;Since the move to democracy and the lifting of sanctions, Myanmar is developing rapidly with the help of foreign technology and foreign investment. We believe that VIASPACE Giant King Grass will be important for bioenergy and other applications. JUNE has the goal to be our country&#39;s leading company in green and natural products and technology.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;Myanmar&#39;s recent national reconciliation and economic reforms have placed it on the world stage of business development. Prominent international organizations including the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank have welcomed these reforms and have expressed willingness to support economic and infrastructure growth in Myanmar. The military government ran power projects in the past, now the new civilian government is granting permission to local and foreign companies to generate power. We hope to work with our partners to create a viable and vibrant renewable biomass/bioenergy business model to serve the national interests and growth in Myanmar.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black">Dr. Kukkonen conducted research and presented a paper entitled &quot;Electricity Options for Myanmar&#39;s Future&quot; to a government advisory panel, the Renewable Energy Association of Myanmar, and at the American Center of the US Embassy in Yangon.</span></p><p>The Republic of the Union of Myanmar, formerly named Burma, is the size of Texas with a population of 55 million people compared to 26 million in Texas. Myanmar is located in Southeast Asia on the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal between Bangladesh and Thailand. Myanmar also has borders with India, China and Laos. Myanmar has considerable natural resources including petroleum, natural gas, minerals and precious stones such as jade ruby and sapphire.<span>&nbsp; </span>Three quarters of the people do not have electricity, and increasing electricity supply is a national priority. </p><p>The previous military government instituted significant reforms including an election, and a nominally civilian parliamentary government took power in 2011. In response to the reforms, the US, European and other governments have lifted or suspended sanctions and are supporting development and reconciliation in Myanmar. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Myanmar in 2011, and the US has resumed full the domestic relations with Myanmar and appointed an ambassador.

Giant King Grass has <a href="http://viaspace.com/press_article.php?id=1377">been extensively tested</a> in independent laboratories and the results are excellent. The high yield of Giant King Grass makes it the lowest cost feedstock for electricity generation using direct combustion or anaerobic digestion or the production of cellulosic sugars for biofuels and biochemicals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The company released a photo of VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen standing with Giant King Grass growing in California. The grass is 10 feet tall and will be harvested when it reaches 15-18 feet. (If the photo is not displayed, click this link: <a href="http://www.pricetargetmedia.com/images/viaspace_giant_king_grass_biofuel.jpg">http://www.pricetargetmedia.com/images/viaspace_giant_king_grass_biofuel.jpg</a>). </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen stated &quot;California is a leader in renewable energy, and we believe that Giant King Grass can play <a href="http://viaspace.com/giant_king_grass_info.php">an important role in electricity generation</a>, and as a feedstock for nonfood cellulosic biofuels such as ethanol and butanol, and also for biochemicals and bioplastics. California is a leading state for agriculture and its warm weather makes it a good place to grow Giant King Grass. Giant King Grass can be grown on marginal lands and will not displace agriculture production.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;VIASPACE&#39;s strategy is to expand aggressively in the United States, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The California site will provide Giant King Grass seedlings for customers and partners in other states, and it will be exported to other countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>The California site will also provide a convenient &quot;showroom&quot; for potential customers that want to see Giant King Grass for themselves.

More and more project developers are realizing that they need to control their fuel source and a companion Giant King Grass energy plantation allows them to do this. Co-location of the plantation and the power plant or bio refinery simplifies logistics and reduces costs significantly. The cost reductions attributable to the high yield of Giant King Grass plus co-location can dramatically increase project profitability.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kevin Schewe, VIASPACE chairman, commented: &quot;I have personally toured and experienced our California GKG site. I can bear witness that Giant King Grass is an impressive, high yield biomass crop and its shear density of growth is amazing. For example, when you walk into the middle of our GKG plot in California where the grass has matured in height, the sunlight nearly disappears.

(1381, 'Board Chairman Interviews with TheStockRadio Program Regarding the Future of VIASPACE', '', '<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">October 29, 2012 --- Walnut, California---VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, conducted a detailed interview with Karl Marek of TheStockRadio Show regarding the recent corporate separation of VIASPACE from VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE) and the future of VIASPACE as a stand alone company. </span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The following is a transcript from the interview which was released by TheStockRadio on Friday, October 26, 2012.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interview can be listened to at </span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><a href="http://thestockradio.com/viaspace-inc-vspcotc-qb/1737">http://thestockradio.com/viaspace-inc-vspcotc-qb/1737</a>.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: What led to the separation of VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy? </span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: Our previous partner, Mr. Sung Chang, decided to move in a different direction with VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE), Inter Pacific Arts (IPA), and the Yingde, China Pellet Mill. VIASPACE held VGE&#39;s stock but we owed Mr. Chang $5.6 million. Mr. Chang could have foreclosed on VIASPACE but foreclosure was a lose-lose solution for all shareholders including me, Mr. Chang, our CEO (Carl Kukkonen), our CFO (Stephen Muzi) and at least a thousand general, VIASPACE common shareholders who would have all been left holding &quot;wallpaper&quot;. With Mr. Chang&#39;s agreement and help, we embarked on a plan to save VIASPACE and split VIASPACE and VGE into &quot;sister companies&quot; that would both work to advance Giant King Grass (GKG) as the world&#39;s leading, renewable bioenergy platform.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: What are the highlights of the VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy Separation Agreement?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: Under the Separation Agreements, the $5.6 million debt to Chang was satisfied with VIASPACE returning all the VGE stock shares. As a result, VIASPACE became a stand-alone company and VGE, Inter Pacific Arts and the China Pellet Mill went to Chang. Both VIASPACE and VGE have remained as publicly traded companies. VIASPACE negotiated a Giant King Grass license agreement to commercialize GKG which covers the entire world outside China and Taiwan (VGE will commercialize GKG in China and Taiwan). VIASPACE will pay an 8% royalty fee to VGE for future GKG commercial revenues. Also as part of the separation, I agreed to provide VIASPACE a million dollars over five years in the form of a secured, convertible loan. I have been given the irrevocable proxy to the vote the company&#39;s 50.1% class-A preferred stock share and that stock share will be transferred to me after five years or when the company&#39;s market capitalization exceeds $50 million--whichever occurs first. Finally, insiders holding a total of 47% the current outstanding stock shares have agreed to a &quot;lock-up&quot; of those shares which prohibits trading or transferring those shares for the next 6 months.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: How has the separation of the companies affected shareholders (including yourselves)?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: Accomplishing the separation has averted foreclosure and has preserved VIASPACE as a viable, publicly traded company with a very bright future. The VIASPACE management, board of directors and me personally, worked very hard to negotiate a separation and license agreement that gives us and all VIASPACE shareholders an excellent probability that we will succeed as a stand-alone company and continually build shareholder value going forward from here. VIASPACE Management agreed to a 33% pay reduction as part of a comprehensive plan to control expenses. Everyone who holds VIASPACE common shares is holding a tradable equity that now has significant upside potential. Our shareholders will see a new company totally focused on growth and shareholder value.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: What are the prospects for VIASPACE&#39;s success on your own?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: I like this question Karl because it relates to where we have come from and where we are going. Since 2008, our CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, has been laying the foundation of where our proprietary Giant King Grass fits into the emerging world of renewable biomass/bioenergy products. Laying this foundation has required research and development, rigorous and repeated testing of Giant King Grass by many reputable, independent laboratories and testing facilities, numerous speaking engagements at national and international conferences, and finally, commercialization of Giant King Grass in the real world to create a profitable business model. During that time frame from 2008 until 2012, the world&#39;s economies have been generally sluggish and slow to move forward with green, renewable bioenergy projects. We have watched other green energy companies not make it through this difficult time. VIASPACE has survived and has made Giant King Grass well-known to the global renewable&#39;s industries. Since the Spring of 2012, we have seen a definite surge in the global interest in our product, Giant King Grass, and customers recognize our expertise to use Giant King Grass as the highest yielding biomass crop in the world. With the separation of the companies behind us, VIASPACE is now poised for huge success at commercializing Giant King Grass worldwide (outside of China and Taiwan).</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: Let&#39;s now talk about your future as a stand-alone company. What is your business strategy going forward from here?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: The short answer, &quot;deals, deals and more deals!&quot; During the so-called &quot;downtime&quot; of our company while we negotiated the separation, I instructed our CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, to get Giant King Grass growing in as many places as possible and I am pushing Carl seven days a week to get the deals lined up and executed. This strategy is working and we are more excited and optimistic about the success of this company than ever before. On October 3&#39;rd, we announced our first real deal: a 20-year, 1,500 acre Giant King Grass supply contract with Tibbar Energy in St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) for a 6 MW anaerobic biogas power plant. Electricity on St. Croix is currently generated with diesel and heavy fuel oil which is very expensive and produces substantial carbon dioxide emissions. We are partnering with Tibbar to use continuously renewable Giant King Grass as the dedicated bioenergy crop to fuel the power plant with a lower cost than fuel oil and negligible carbon dioxide emissions. This 20-year project is slated to be underway in 2013, fully on-line by first quarter 2014 and will generate over 20 full time jobs with a total economic benefit of $150 million to the community over the life of the project. Our business relationship with Tibbar has been excellent and we hope that our partnership will grow with them in the Caribbean region. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">On October 16, we announced that we have signed business development and confidentiality agreements and received payment from June Industry Ltd. in Myanmar. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, borders India, China and Laos and has the perfect climate for growing Giant King Grass. The previous military government ran power plant projects in the past, but now the new civilian government is granting permission to local and foreign companies to generate power. We envision Giant King Grass playing an important role in Myanmar&#39;s future, not only for electricity generation, but also for biofuels and other applications. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for VIASPACE to succeed with our partners in Myanmar.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We are actively engaged in the various stages of several other deals and we are contacted regularly from companies that we have visited with in the past or who are brand new to us. All of them have one thing in common: they need a high-yield, renewable, nonfood, dedicated green energy crop for green electricity and biofuels. We have the answer to their need: Giant King Grass and the expertise to make it work for their projects.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently approved Giant King Grass in the United States. Today, October 22, you announced that Giant King Grass is growing in California. Can you tell us about these developments?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: These developments are huge for our company! Our proprietary product, Giant King Grass, has been vigorously tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Heath Inspection Service (APHIS) and has been released from quarantine for distribution in the United States. Giant King Grass in non-invasive and has been found to be pathogen free--we have been issued our U.S. phytosanitary certificate. We can now grow Giant King Grass anywhere in the continental United States and also including the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and Hawaii.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">On October 22, we announced that Giant King Grass is growing in California. Remember that Giant King Grass grows best in warm climates and it is not frost-resistant. So I can be specific only in telling you that it is growing in Southern California. The state of California is a recognized leader in renewable energy and for agriculture in general. Giant King Grass can be grown on marginal lands and will not displace agricultural food production. Biomass electricity from GKG is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for base power and Giant King Grass is also suitable for cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics. We hope to play an active role in the green energy future of California.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Our California site serves several important purposes for VIASPACE. First, we wanted to know how well Giant King Grass grows in Southern California--the answer is that it grows great there--it loves the climate there! We have been able to conduct some agronomic experiments on planting, germination, fertilization and water requirements. The site serves as a convenient U.S. &quot;showroom&quot; for potential customers so they can actually see and experience Giant King Grass for themselves. This site will also provide Giant King Grass seedlings for customers and partners in other states and export to other places. We can also provide grass samples for testing by customers. Our strategy is to rapidly and aggressively expand in the United States, Caribbean and Central and South America. Having our roots down in California fits perfectly into our corporate strategy!</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe commented, &quot;The interview with TheStockRadio was a great opportunity to get the message of VIASPACE&#39;s bright future out to a wider audience and potentially attract new investors. We have recently taken additional steps to broaden our audience by connecting VIASPACE to social media. We have recently launched our corporate links to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have updated the VIASPACE website at <a href="..//" target="_blank" title="http://www.viaspace.com/">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>.

The United States, European Union and the United Nations are aggressively working to help Myanmar. Only 27% of the population has electricity at all. GDP growth is projected at 10% per year. Electricity is needed for poverty alleviation and industrial development. Everyone recognizes that electricity is the key to development and becoming a modern society. Solar and wind energy are transient and require backup generation capability that is not available on the grid in Myanmar yet. Biomass electricity is base energy that can be delivered 24 hours a day. This was recognized by everyone at the Forum.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;I presented specific biomass electricity generation options using Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass. A One MW biogas power plant using anaerobic digestion of Giant King Grass can be built in 12 months and would serve up to 13,000 rural families and provide electricity for schools and small factories. This can be set up in a rural area including a micro-grid for electricity generation and provide electricity at a cost that is much less expensive than using diesel generators.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 30 MW direct combustion power plant would serve up to 400,000 rural families and provide a 2% increase in electricity available in Myanmar. It could be standalone in a rural region or connected to the grid.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both options are scalable and multiple power plants could be built in a short time. Myanmar is very well suited for Giant King Grass.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented: &quot;Myanmar is emerging from a closed society to an open society with an exciting future. Along with our partners in Myanmar, we plan to demonstrate how Giant King Grass can provide a green, versatile and continuously renewable bioenergy platform for electricity generation, biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics. Our CEO is currently traveling and meeting with existing and potential customers in Southeast Asia and we are also very busy working on Giant King Grass deals in the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa.

(1384, 'Board Chairman and CEO Conduct Interview with The Green Baron Report', '', '<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">November 26, 2012 --- Walnut, California---VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe and CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen conducted a detailed interview with Phil Kreider of The Green Baron Report at TheGreenBaron.com regarding the recent corporate separation of VIASPACE from VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE) and future business of VIASPACE as a stand alone company. </span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The following is a transcript from the interview which was released by Green Baron.<span>&nbsp; </span>The webcast interview can be listened to at </span><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="http://www.thegreenbaron.com/Webcasts.htm">www.thegreenbaron.com/Webcasts.htm</a></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">.</span></p><p style="text-align: center" align="center">&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 2, VIASPACE announced the orderly separation of VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy. Please explain the terms of the separation and how the separation will benefit VIASPACE and its shareholders.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Kevin Schewe--In 2008, VIASPACE and Mr. Sung Chang joined forces in an effort to introduce and commercialize our proprietary bioenergy product,&nbsp;Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mr. Chang&#39;s framed art company, Inter-Pacific Arts, provided cash revenues to fund both VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy. From 2008 until 2012, our CEO Dr. Kukkonen became the world&#39;s leading Giant King Grass expert and through numerous invited&nbsp;presentations at international conferences and many meetings with potential customers, he&nbsp;introduced our product to the world. During the same time period, Giant King Grass was rigorously tested by many independent laboratories and found to be an excellent fuel and feedstock for electricity generation, energy pellets and for biofuels and biochemicals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass is the highest yielding, continuously renewable,&nbsp;dedicated bioenergy crop in the world. This research and business development phase took time and effort but in retrospect was quite successful at establishing the reputation of VIASPACE as an emerging green energy company and Giant King Grass as a tier one renewable,&nbsp;bioenergy product.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Earlier this year, Mr. Chang decided to move in a different direction with VIASPACE Green Energy and the framed art business.<span>&nbsp; </span>We mutually decided to split VIASPACE and VIASPACE Green Energy into &quot;sister companies&quot; that would both work to take the next step to commercialize Giant King Grass as the world&#39;s leading renewable bioenergy platform. VIASPACE previously held VGE&#39;s stock but we owed Mr. Chang $5.6 million. Under the terms of the separation, the $5.6 million debt to Chang was satisfied with VIASPACE returning the VGE stock shares it owned to him. As a result, VIASPACE became a stand-alone company and VIASPACE&#39;s ownership in VIASPACE Green Energy went to Chang.<span>&nbsp; </span>VIASPACE has the exclusive worldwide license for Giant King Grass outside of China and Taiwan.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE and its shareholders have benefited from the separation by eliminating the overhang of our prior $5.6 million debt and emerging as a pure play in bioenergy.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are now totally focused on the commercialization of Giant King Grass as our core business.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have moved from a research and development company to a deal making company focused on creating a new, robust and&nbsp;organic revenue stream for our future and for our shareholders. </span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Additionally, in the October 2 press release, it was announced that Director Kevin Schewe, the holder of 100 million shares of VSPC common stock, entered into a loan agreement with VIASPACE in the form of a secured convertible note. Since we have Dr. Schewe with us here today, there is no better time to ask about the details of this financing and the positive support you continue to provide the Company.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Kevin Schewe--As part of the separation of VIASPACE from VGE, I agreed to provide VIASPACE a million dollars in the form of a secured, convertible loan. This was important because VIASPACE needs this positive financial support in the wake of the separation. VIASPACE does have revenues, for example, the&nbsp;initial phases of the deals we have already&nbsp;announced in St. Croix and Myanmar, but this does not yet cover the expenses of being a public company.&nbsp;As a result of my tangible financial&nbsp;commitment to&nbsp;the company, I have been given the irrevocable proxy to vote the Company&#39;s 50.1% class-A preferred stock share, and I will use that share to advance the cause of VIASPACE shareholders. Investors should&nbsp;note that&nbsp;I have recently converted my first two loans, which together&nbsp;totaled $85,000, into VIASPACE common shares. These shares are restricted for six months and this should send a strong message regarding my belief that these shares are going to be an even more valuable investment going forward.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 3, it was announced that VIASPACE signed a 1,500 acre Giant King Grass supply contract with Tibbar Energy. Tell us about this contract, when it should come on line, and what kind of revenues you hope to achieve.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Kukkonen --This is a &quot;real deal&quot; that our investors have been waiting for us to announce. It is a 20-year, 1,500 acre Giant King Grass supply contract with Tibbar Energy in St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) for a 6MW anaerobic biogas power plant. Electricity on St. Croix is currently generated with diesel and heavy fuel oil which is very expensive and produces substantial carbon dioxide emissions. We are partnering with Tibbar to use continuously renewable Giant King Grass as the dedicated, non-food, bioenergy crop to fuel the power plant with a lower cost than fuel oil and negligible carbon dioxide emissions. This 20-year project is slated to be underway in 2013 and fully on-line by first quarter 2014 and will generate over 20 full time jobs with a total economic benefit&nbsp;of $150 million to the community over the life of the project. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We are already&nbsp;generating revenues in the consulting, design and implementation of the project, but our real revenues will be from our ongoing license fee collected as the Giant King Grass is continually harvested. We have proven to our customers that they actually save money in operational costs and efficiencies&nbsp;by using the extremely high&nbsp;bioenergy yield from VIASPACE&#39;s&nbsp;Giant King Grass and paying a license fee&nbsp;than by using lower yielding, less productive crops. The precise terms of the agreement with Tibbar are confidential, but our revenues are regular and dependable over the life of the project. </span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 9, VIASPACE announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture officially approved Giant King Grass in the United States. What does this victory mean for the Company and how will this help you market the product going forward?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Kukkonen --USDA approval of Giant King Grass validates our product in the eyes of the world, and also allows us to enter the US market.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass was vigorously tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service for over one year, and found to be pathogen free. It was approved for distribution in the United States.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can now grow Giant King Grass in the United States. Having passed the rigorous standards of the USDA gives our customers here in the U.S. and worldwide&nbsp;peace of mind regarding the safety of our product.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 11, it was announced that you, Dr. Kukkonen (the CEO), the CFO, Stephen Muzi and Director Angelina Galiteva have all agreed to a 6 month lock-up of their VIASPACE stock shares. You and Mr. Muzi&nbsp;also agreed to 33% salary reductions to trim corporate expenses. Please explain the purpose of the lock-up and pay cuts.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Kukkonen --As part of the separation, Dr.&nbsp;Schewe, and Mr. Chang<span>&nbsp; </span>agreed to a six month lock-up of their VIASPACE shares to<span>&nbsp; </span>demonstrate their belief<span>&nbsp; </span>in the&nbsp;future of the company. Our CFO, Stephen Muzi and I, and our other Board Director, Angelina Galiteva, likewise wanted to demonstrate our confidence in the future of the company by locking up our shares. In total, insiders holding 47% of the VIASPACE common shares have locked up their shares for 6 months which should reduce potentially volatility that could have been related after the separation of the companies.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As a further step to show our dedication to the success of the separation and the future of VIASPACE, both Mr. Muzi and I accepted a 33% pay cut as part of a comprehensive plan to control expenses. We want our shareholders and anyone interested in our company to know that we are working hard to grow this company and increase shareholder value going forward.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>On Tuesday, October 16, it was announced that VIASPACE signed an agreement in Myanmar with June Industry Ltd. It appears that this relationship could develop into something new and different. Please explain.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Kukkonen --We are very excited to now be part of Myanmar&#39;s future. President Obama is going to Myanmar next week. The US is strongly supporting the move to democracy in Myanmar, and is encouraging new business relationships. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has the perfect climate for growing Giant King Grass. The previous military government ran power plant projects in the past, but now the new civilian government is granting permission to local and foreign companies to generate power. Just last week, I made an invited presentation at the Forum on Renewable Energy Development in Myanmar held by the Asian Development Bank which is expected to provide funding for<span>&nbsp; </span>power plant projects including biomass in Myanmar. At the forum, the German company Conergy presented on solar energy and General Electric made a presentation on wind. I represented biomass. My presentation entitled &quot;Biomass Electricity Production Options for Myanmar&quot; is available on the VIASPACE website at <a href="..//" target="_blank">http://www.viaspace.com/</a>. I presented specific biomass electricity generation options using Giant King Grass for Myanmar, including small power plants using anaerobic digestion and larger 30-90MW direct combustion power plants. Both options are scalable and multiple power plants all fueled by Giant King Grass could be built in a short time.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">I have spent more than three months in Myanmar this year and have established good relationships with our partners there. We believe that Giant King Grass can become the perfect, continuously renewable, non-food, dedicated bioenergy platform for local&nbsp;electricity generation and also for other&nbsp;bioenergy products such as pellets that can be used locally or exported to other nations.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 22, it was announced that the USDA approved Giant King Grass was growing in California.&nbsp;Please explain the benefit and importance of your California site.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Kukkonen --Our California site serves several important purposes for VIASPACE. First, we wanted to prove that Giant King Grass grows well here in the United States. It loves the California climate and we have proven that it can be used for renewable bioenergy production in the Southern United States. This site now serves as a convenient U.S. &quot;showroom&quot; for potential customers so they can actually see and experience Giant King Grass for themselves. Importantly, the site serves as a propagation nursery which provides Giant King Grass seedlings for US customers and partners in other countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can provide grass samples to customers or labs&nbsp;for bioenergy testing. Having our California site will help us to expand in the United States, the Caribbean, Central and South America.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl, What can you tell us about your recent efforts on behalf of the Company?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Kukkonen-- VIASPACE is now actively involved in bioenergy project development. We are not only a premier supplier of dedicated biomass; we now are serving as project developers together with partners to bring power plant and other bioenergy projects to fruition.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass is an enabling technology. With its high yield, we can produce electricity and biofuels at a lower cost than the competitors.<span>&nbsp; </span>With our partners, we can deliver a biogas power plant in 12 months and a larger direct combustion power plant in 24 months including the Giant King Grass plantation.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have full financial models to support the economic side of the projects. We are in contact with both debt and equity financers for power plant projects.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">In a power plant project, VIASPACE will not only receive the license fees for the Giant King Grass, it will have an equity participation in the power plant which will generate additional revenue.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">In the last six months, I have traveled extensively and met with many potential partners and customers. We are working on projects in eight countries and have signed several contracts. The contracts in St. Croix and Myanmar have been announced, and the others are covered by confidentiality agreements and will be disclosed at the appropriate time.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question:<span>&nbsp; </span>When do you believe that VIASPACE can achieve profitability and what we else would you like to tell an investor that might be considering a purchase of VSPC stock?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Kevin Schewe-- VIASPACE is now poised for huge success at commercializing Giant King Grass worldwide as the highest yielding biomass crop in the world. We should begin to see revenues from our license agreements in&nbsp;2013 and profitability in 2014. We have many deals in various stages of development and plan to announce those as they are completed. We are actively engaged in business deals and project development in the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa and Southeast Asia. We believe that we have a solid foundation, a unique product, an aggressive business plan and the expertise and commitment to see it all through to resounding success! </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">With regards to what I would like to tell an investor that might be considering an investment in VIASPACE, consider the following. When I joined the VIASPACE board of directors in January 2012, I owned about 65,000,000 shares of VSPC. Since that time, I have been aggressively accumulating additional shares, and as of today, now preferentially own just north of 127,000,000 shares which is nearly twice what I owned less than a year ago. As an insider, I continue to accumulate shares and that should send a strong message of support to current and&nbsp;potential investors.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are presently a penny stock, microcap company, but we aspire to much greater value and we&nbsp;are actively&nbsp;engaged in making deals happen. We want and plan to make Giant King Grass the world&#39;s&nbsp;leading, renewable, non-food, bioenergy platform for bioelectricity, exportable bioenergy pellets,&nbsp;biochemicals and bioplastics. I think that VIASPACE is an investment worth considering.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About The Green Baron Report </span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Green Baron Report is a subsidiary of Evergreen Marketing.

(1386, 'VIASPACE Chairman Interviews with WallStreetReporter and Provides Commentary', '', '<span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">December 6, 2012 - Walnut, California - </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) <span>today announced that Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, conducted a detailed interview with Juan Costello of the WallStreetReporter on Friday, November 30, 2012, to discuss the recent corporate developments at VIASPACE and how the company is positioning itself to succeed in the bioenergy sector. The full interview can be heard using the following link: <a href="http://www.wallstreetreporter.com/2012/12/viaspace-otcqbvspc-chairman-kevin-schewe/" target="_blank" title="http://www.wallstreetreporter.com/2012/12/viaspace-otcqbvspc-chairman-kevin-schewe/">http://www.wallstreetreporter.com/2012/12/viaspace-otcqbvspc-chairman-kevin-schewe/</a>.</span></span> <p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe commented regarding the interview, &quot;This was a new investor audience to VIASPACE and I spent the first half of the interview reviewing our history and then detailing all our recent news announcements since the first of October. However, the last two questions gave me an opportunity to provide an interesting overview of our status and outlook.&quot; The following is a transcript of the last two questions.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: What is your viewpoint on the opportunities and challenges in the sector, and how are you positioning your company to capitalize?</span></strong></p><p><span><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:</span></strong></span><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"> The opportunities are enormous and quite literally global in scope. For example, we are currently engaged in the various stages of new business deals in eight different countries around the world. We have done an excellent job of increasing the global awareness of Giant King Grass as the highest yielding, dedicated energy crop in the world. We are not randomly pounding on doors; new customers are now calling us and requesting to meet with us, many of them are actually anxious to get started with Giant King Grass projects and we get involved in helping them with their due diligence as step number one.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Our immediate opportunities are:</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">1) Direct combustion of Giant King Grass to create green and clean bioelectricity--typically a 30-90 MW power plant. By co-locating a Giant King Grass plantation with a power plant you eliminate transportation costs of fuel and maximize efficiencies.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">2) Anaerobic biodigestion of Giant King Grass to produce biogas which is burned in an engine or turbine to run a generator and produce electricity. This is what we are doing on St. Croix for 6MW of power; typical sizes are one to six megawatts. The interesting and intriguing byproduct of this process is organic fertilizer.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">3) Giant King Grass can be pelletized and those pellets can be co-fired with coal to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions or carbon footprint of coal-fired electricity production. This helps meet carbon reduction targets and can replace up to 20% of coal in an existing coal-fired plant. We grow the grass, it&#39;s harvested, dried and pressed into pellets and shipped in bulk like shipping grain--in other words, Giant King Grass becomes a bio-commodity like shipping fuel--only it&#39;s continuously renewable, green energy! Sixteen million tons of pellets are used globally today and estimates are that increases to 46 million tons by 2020. There is a growing global demand for pellets, particularly Europe, Korea, China, and Japan is also emerging. Regarding opportunity, I see Myanmar as a perfect place to create and export pellets.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">4) The low cost of Giant King Grass creates new opportunities for commercial applications in the future, including: Cellulosic Ethanol--by co-locating a Giant King Grass plantation and an ethanol production facility you can reduce feedstock costs by 40-50% making cellulosic ethanol profitable. There are several other possibilities including: bioplastics/biochemicals; pyrolysis to bio-oil; catalytic conversion to biodiesel; biopulp for paper and textiles.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We have business deals and partnerships evolving in Southeast Asia, Africa, Korea, the Caribbean, the Americas including Central America and Hawaii. We are positioning ourselves to capitalize by focusing on Giant King Grass as the ideal, highest yielding bioenergy platform and making it global in scope.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">With regards to challenges, I would say, &quot;Always follow the money.&quot; From a financial perspective, the green energy sector in general has run hot and cold over the past decade. Our challenge is to prove to our customers and show the world, including the investment community that Giant King Grass with its extremely high yield can meet cost targets for energy and biofuel applications. The high yield of Giant King Grass is crucial to make biomass electricity competitive and affordable. Banks and investors will not finance biomass power plants without a long term fuel supply contract. Giant King Grass provides a reliable, well documented, consistent quality fuel supply or feedstock with a predictable, affordable price. We have demonstrated to our clients that they actually save money by paying VIASPACE a license fee for high yielding Giant King Grass as opposed to using a lower yielding, naturally occurring biomass source.</span></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: Why do you believe that your stock is worth buying today? What do you believe are the specific growth factors which could positively impact the stock price?</span></strong></p><p><span><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer:</span></strong></span><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"> Since September 30th, I have loaned the company $105,000 in the form of 3 monthly, secured, convertible loans. As of this week (we filed the 8-K late yesterday), I have already converted all 3 of those loans to common stock. Why would I do that? Because I absolutely, positively believe that our stock is worth buying today! Where else can you buy a stock at a penny or pennies per share to own a company that has a transformational green energy platform product, the unique expertise to commercialize that product and active deals in progress in a minimum of eight different countries literally spanning the globe? Earlier this year, when I first joined the VIASPACE Board, I was buying VSPC common shares on the open market. Now I am buying them as an insider and have essentially doubled my holdings since January 2012--I now preferentially hold nearly 130,000,000 shares and continue to accumulate shares.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We have very minimal debt, we&#39;ll be generating new, organic revenue in 2013 and I believe profitable in 2014. Our business model is to collect regular, predictable license fees as Giant King Grass is harvested by our customers over the life of their projects--that life measured in decades. In a power plant project, VIASPACE will not only receive the license fee from harvested Giant King Grass, we&#39;ll also have an equity participation in the power plant which will generate recurring revenue from the sale of local electricity.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Our CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, is literally traveling the world as the passionate and driven CEO of VIASPACE and Giant king Grass. He has spent more than 3 months in Myanmar this year. We are building partnerships there, in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Americas--including the Caribbean. Our proprietary product, Giant King Grass, is not just any plant; </span></span><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">it is a dedicated, continuously renewable, bioenergy PLATFORM. </span></strong><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">When developed and grown and used to its full potential--it is a </span></span><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">game changer--an enabling green technology</span></strong><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"> for bioelectricity that is nearly as competitive as coal in price but overall carbon neutral. More importantly, it can be used, as I said, for a platform for bioelectricity, pellets for co-firing with coal, biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">When the investment community clearly recognizes the true scope of our current efforts, the global reach of our projects and the revenues that we create, I believe that our share price will begin to reflect a global company with a global product and global reach as a huge success story in the evolution of green energy. Giant King Grass begins as a seed and grows rapidly to 17 feet in height. I believe that is an appropriate metaphor for investors looking at our company at this very point in time.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe commented, &quot;I enjoyed this interview with the WallStreetReporter and it gave me the opportunity to clearly explain that we will be generating continuous revenues from our Giant King Grass license fees on every project and also will generate additional revenue from the sale of electricity in projects where we have equity participation in the power plant. We are actively working on both types of deals. We are shipping and delivering Giant King Grass seedlings to several clients and will announce those projects and deals in the near future at mutually agreed upon times. This is an exciting time at VIASPACE and for our shareholders.&quot;</span></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

(OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that its proprietary dedicated energy crop, <a href="../giant_king_grass.php">Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass</a> (GKG), is now growing in Hawaii.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, stated &quot;Hawaii has the highest electricity rates of any US state because their electricity is mostly generated from expensive imported oil. Hawaii&#39;s electric rates range from $.30 - $.40 per kilowatt hour depending on the cost of oil. This is two or three times the cost of electricity on the US mainland.<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="../green_electricity.php">Bioelectricity</a> from Giant King Grass is substantially cheaper than oil generated electricity and has much lower carbon emissions.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, the large military presence on Hawaii has requirements for liquid biofuels for aircraft and ships. We believe that Hawaii should be an important part of the VIASPACE US strategy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Previously, VIASPACE announced that Giant King Grass has been released from quarantine by the <a href="../press_article.php?id=1377">US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)</a> for distribution in the United States.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hawaii, however, has additional plant import rules, and the Giant King Grass is being grown in a facility under the purview of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen personally supervised the planting in Hawaii and met with Department of Agriculture officials as well as with potential Giant King Grass customers in Hawaii. Kukkonen continued, &quot;The climate in Hawaii is ideal for Giant King Grass. There are substantial tracts of land available on different Hawaiian Islands that were previously used to grow sugarcane and pineapple.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are lying fallow now and can be used for energy crop production.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;Giant King Grass can also become an important part of the tourism industry which is crucial for Hawaii&#39;s economy. Not only can Giant King Grass provide clean electricity for hotels and resorts, visiting the Giant King Grass plantations and co-located green power plants can become one of the islands&#39; tourist attractions like visits to the sugar and pineapple plantations.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass could become the source of electricity for the entire island of <a href="http://www.gohawaii.com/lanai">Lanai</a>--recently purchased by <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/executives/ellison/index.html">Oracle CEO Larry Ellison</a>-- and make it one of the world&#39;s first green resort destinations.<span>&nbsp; </span>This concept is not unique to Hawaii and applies to many islands and nations with tropical climates that depend on oil for their electricity. For these applications, Giant King Grass generated electricity is<span>&nbsp; </span>significantly cheaper, continuously renewable and green.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, added: &quot;The Giant King Grass now growing in Hawaii was provided by the VIASPACE nursery in <a href="../press_article.php?id=1380">California</a>. We have recently shipped GKG seedlings from California for projects with three other customers and Dr. Kukkonen is currently out of the country and personally supervising planting of GKG with one of these new customers.

(OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that it has signed a project agreement and received initial funding from Selectra CC of Johannesburg South Africa. VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen delivered <a href="../giant_king_grass.php">Giant King<sup>TM</sup> Grass</a> (GKG) to South Africa, supervised the first planting, and held business meetings with Selectra and their partners.</span></span> <p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Selectra is a leading developer of sustainable bioenergy projects in Africa and sought out Giant King Grass as a dedicated energy crop.<span>&nbsp; </span>Selectra is considering both <a href="../bio_methane.php">biogas</a> and <a href="../green_electricity.php">direct combustion biomass power plants</a>. VIASPACE and Selectra may join forces on specific future projects. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Selectra obtained an import permit from the South African government for Giant King Grass that required detailed inspection and treatment. Accordingly, <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US agriculture officials</a> inspected the VIASPACE nursery in <a href="../press_article.php?id=1380">California</a> and witnessed the treatment required by South Africa, and then issued the phytosanitary certificate stating that the Giant King Grass was free of disease and pests.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The first specific project for Selectra is to produce energy on land that has been affected by mining in South Africa. Mining is a very large industry in South Africa, and there are many mine affected lands. For example, gold mining produces large amounts of ore from which the gold has been extracted. There are thousands of hectares of these &quot;mine dumps&quot; or more correctly stated slimes dams and mine tailings (the footprint that remains after a slimes dam has been removed for further processing). </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen and representatives from Selectra visited two different mining locations for the start of this business relationship. Selectra and VISPACE are conducting two trials, namely on mine affected land and on mine tailings; the success of which will significantly contribute to development of local communities with other social benefits associated with remediation of mine affected land.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass is a candidate crop to remediate mine affected land through the removal of heavy metals by <a href="http://www.epa.gov/superfund/accomp/news/phyto.htm">phytoremediation</a> and by returning organic matter into the tailings to make soil. Another important benefit could be the reduction of dust and erosion on the slimes dams thereby contributing to better health for local communities. Incorporation of Giant King Grass in Selectra&#39;s mining program results in a truly sustainable solution as the grass is then harvested for bioenergy applications thereby offsetting the costs of the program.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;<a href="http://www.southafrica.info/travel/advice/climate.htm">South Africa</a> has a good climate for Giant King Grass and we are pleased to be working with Selectra.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are certain that Giant King Grass will grow well on the unmined land, and are hopeful about the prospects for bio remediation of the mine dumps and tailings. The Giant King Grass test plantings will tell us whether Giant King Grass will grow on dumps and tailings or not. We cannot guarantee the results, but if Giant King Grass can be successfully grown on mine affected land, this will represent another very large market.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Selectra Commercial Director Dwight Rosslee reports, &quot;We have grown beets and sorghum on the tailings dams. These are annual crops. We believe that Giant King Grass will have significant advantages because it is a perennial crop that does not require replanting every year, and the root system will deposit organic matter into the soil. If it is successful, we plan to build a biomass power plant to generate electricity from the Giant King Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will have taken a major environmental problem and turned it into a major asset.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented: &quot;We are genuinely excited about our project with Selecta in South Africa to grow GKG on unmined lands and the new possibility of expanding the role of Giant King Grass for the purpose of phytoremediation and linking that process to carbon neutral bioenergy production. The African Continent represents a large and important market for VIASPACE. We are now growing Giant King Grass and are actively engaged in Africa, <a href="../press_article.php?id=1379">Myanmar</a>, the Caribbean, <a href="../press_article.php?id=1390">Hawaii</a>, Central America, the United States and elsewhere. We have many exciting projects in various stages of development and we will continue to announce the details of those deals according to our clients&#39; timelines and schedules.

In addition, VIASPACE sponsored a booth in the Convention Exhibit Hall featuring two, towering, harvested examples of <a href="../giant_king_grass.php">Giant King Grass</a>. On Monday evening, January 29, Dr. Kukkonen and Dr. Schewe together <a href="../press_article.php?id=1389">hosted VIASPACE shareholders</a> for a presentation and question and answer session.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen reported, &quot;The EUEC Meeting, now in its 16th consecutive year, provided an impressive technical program.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were over 1800 attendees and 150 exhibitors including VIASPACE. This year&#39;s conference was focused on safe and clean energy development and the use of U.S. domestic resources. I met with prospective clients and partners to discuss expanding the footprint of Giant King Grass in the United States and elsewhere. My presentation was well received and follow-up discussions have led to new business prospects.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interest in using GKG as a dedicated, continuously renewable bioenergy platform is rapidly accelerating given our recent progress in <a href="../press_article.php?id=1391">South Africa</a>, <a href="../press_article.php?id=1388">St. Croix</a>, <a href="../press_article.php?id=1379">Myanmar</a>, Central America, <a href="../press_article.php?id=1380">California</a> and <a href="../press_article.php?id=1390">Hawaii</a>.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe also commented, &quot;This was my second major VIASPACE meeting to attend with Dr. Kukkonen and his presentations continue to impress those attending regarding the fact that GKG is the highest yielding, non-food, bioenergy platform crop in the world. Our booth in the Phoenix Convention Center Exhibit Hall was intriguing to those attending and the towering Giant King Grass could be seen from any vantage point throughout the exhibit hall. VIASPACE captured a lot of attention from many parties as a result.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr, Schewe added, &quot;Our Monday night meeting with VIASPACE shareholders was a success. I personally met with shareholders who came to Phoenix from different parts of the country, and candidly answered their questions. Some of these questions and answers are worth sharing because not every shareholder is able to come and meet with us in person:</span></p><p><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: Can you comment on the Giant King Grass license and what it means to our Company? </span></em></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: Dr. Schewe responded, &quot;VIASPACE has the exclusive license to grow, market and sell Giant King Grass in the entire world outside China and Taiwan and this is documented in our public filings. We have established ourselves as the world&#39;s premier experts at growing, handling and utilizing this specific energy crop as the highest yielding bioenergy platform crop in the world. Our strength and security are rooted in the extensive, independent, third-party testing of GKG and secondly, in our reputable expertise in showing and partnering with our customers on how to succeed in its use. Of course there are competing products in the bioenergy universe, but we are moving fast to make GKG the preferred platform product because its extremely high yield makes more economic sense than its competitors.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: When will VIASPACE be profitable? </span></em></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: Dr. Schewe responded, &quot;This Company has never been run leaner than its current overhead structure. Both our CEO and CFO took one-third salary pay-cuts on October 1, 2012 when VIASPACE became a stand-alone company. I personally have not drawn a salary for all the work that I have done for the Company. Our other employees work as independent contractors and we rigorously control those costs. All that said, given the number and significance of the deals in our pipeline, I personally believe that we can achieve profitability in 2014.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question: Is our common stock (VSPC) headed for a reverse split? </span></em></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: Dr. Schewe responded, &quot;There are no plans for a reverse split this year or in the near future. I currently hold just north of 130,000,000 common VSPC shares and I purchased each and every one of those shares with my hard-earned money. I purchased more than half of those shares on the open market and the rest at a 20% discount to the prior month&#39;s average trading price according to my formal agreement to assist in funding the ongoing operations of the Company. I believe that VIASPACE is somewhat unique among penny stocks at this time because the Chairman of the Board wasn&#39;t given his stock or awarded his stock in exchange for his work, advice or expertise--he personally paid for it and looks at the stock&#39;s value appreciation as does any other common shareholder. If we had adequate corporate revenues at this very moment, my philosophy would be to use that revenue for continued organic corporate growth and to institute a formal share buy-back plan and retire those common shares as we buy them back to decrease the overall share count. Both actions would work together to significantly increase the value of my common shares and everyone else&#39;s. The <strong>ONLY </strong>circumstance that would ever merit consideration of a reverse split on my watch would be the need to move to a higher exchange because we are growing so fast that we need the financial advantages that only a higher exchange can offer.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe, concluded, &quot;I want our shareholders to know that Dr. Kukkonen and I make a great team working together. We are both scientists by training and background, but Carl is focused on expanding the world&#39;s successful use of Giant King Grass as the leading bioenergy platform and I am focused on the business success of our company and growing shareholder value. Perfect timing is everything in the critical success of business, and as we mutually conveyed at the EUEC 2013 Meeting, we believe that the time is perfect for the success of Giant King Grass as the world&#39;s premier bioenergy platform.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

Since 2008, Carl has been laying the foundation of where our proprietary Giant King Grass (GKG) fits into the emerging world of renewable biomass/bioenergy products. Laying this foundation has required research and development, rigorous and repeated testing of Giant King Grass by many reputable, independent laboratories and testing facilities, numerous speaking engagements at national and international conferences and finally, the commercialization of Giant King Grass in the real world to create a profitable business model. VIASPACE has made <a href="../giant_king_grass.php">Giant King Grass</a> well-known to the global renewable&#39;s industries. Since the Spring of 2012, we have seen a definite surge in the global interest in our product, Giant King Grass, and customers now recognize our expertise to use Giant King Grass as the highest yielding biomass crop in the world. <a href="../green_electricity.php">Bioelectricity</a>, <a href="../bio_methane.php">biogas production</a>, <a href="../biochemicals_bio_plastics.php">biofuels, biochemical, bioplastics and biomaterials</a> all need biomass as a feedstock and GKG is suitable for all these applications. VIASPACE provides GKG seedlings and technical expertise to qualified bioenergy projects that need a low-cost and reliable fuel or feedstock. VIASPACE will also serve as a project developer or co-developer for GKG-fueled power plants or pellet mill projects, together with local partners that have land and requirements for electricity, heat, pellets, biogas or biofuels. VIASPACE and its partners have the capability to deliver integrated GKG plantation and biomass power plant projects in 24 months. VIASPACE has financial models to support power plant and pellet mill projects.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">I joined the VIASPACE Board of Directors in <a href="../press_article.php?id=1356">January of 2012</a> as the second largest investor in the company at that time. I am actually a Board Certified radiation oncologist in private practice and work as a cancer specialist and operate two cancer centers in Colorado in partnership with HealthONE, the Colorado Division of Hospital Corporation of America (<a href="http://hcahealthcare.com/about/">HCA</a>) which is the largest private operator of healthcare facilities in the world and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. I am also an entrepreneur and have developed a premium line of skin care and cosmetic products that help to heal, protect, repair and subsequently maintain not only the damaged skin of cancer patients, but also individuals who have experienced skin damage resulting from aging, dryness, UV exposure, other illnesses and environmental pollution. The products are manufactured by my company, Elite Therapeutics and our story can be seen on our website at <a href="http://www.elitetherapeutics.com/" title="http://www.elitetherapeutics.com/">http://www.elitetherapeutics.com/</a>. I became personally interested in VIASPACE and invested heavily in the company when it became focused in the green energy business sector. I was instrumental in helping VIASPACE split from a previous partner and become a free-standing bioenergy company on 10-01-12 and that is when I became Chairman of the Board of Directors. Carl is focused on expanding the world&#39;s successful use of GKG as the leading bioenergy platform and I am focused on the business success of our company and growing shareholder value.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 2:<span>&nbsp; </span>What exactly is biomass?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Biomass is a fancy word for plant material. <a href="../biomass_versus_alternatives.php">Biomass</a> is low-carbon fuel or energy source that comes from plant material such as wood, sugar cane and grasses such as Giant King Grass. Biomass can be burned to generate electricity and heat, digested to produce bio-methane, and can also be converted into biofuels, biochemical and bioplastics. Biomass also includes byproducts such as agricultural waste, including corn straw (stover) and rice husks, and food waste, such as vegetable oil recycled from cooking processes. Since biomass comes primarily from plants and vegetation that naturally regrows and may come from everyday agricultural or industrial processes, biomass is a renewable resource.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 3:<span>&nbsp; </span>Why is biomass so important as a basis for energy production as opposed to fossil fuels or other sources of energy?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">In contrast to fossil fuels, biomass from plants and vegetation is considered low-carbon or carbon-neutral. During their growing cycle, plants use photosynthesis to absorb and convert sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into nutrients and energy. When these plants are burned, for example in a power plant, carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is again absorbed during the next crop&#39;s growth cycle. This repetitive cycle of absorption-release-absorption results in a carbon-neutral effect on the atmosphere. Since planting, harvesting and transportation equipment use petroleum-based fuel, and many fertilizers are also petroleum based, some carbon emissions occur with biomass. However, when grass crops are grown using sustainable methods, the amounts of carbon emissions are small, especially compared to the energy that will be produced by burning the biomass, and the result is very low carbon emissions, compared to burning coal or other fossil fuels. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Biomass is available in many areas throughout the world and can be cultivated or produced domestically, locally or regionally, with little or no logistical risk. In contrast, reserves of oil and natural gas are located in limited areas throughout the world and are a depleting resource. Of the leading <a href="../biomass_versus_alternatives.php">energy alternatives</a> to fossil fuels, biomass is the most cost-effective and practical, and therefore offers the most realistic and sustainable strategy. For example, solar and wind offer important advantage of zero fuel cost, but they have higher capital costs and much lower utilization rates because solar only produces electricity when it is sunny and wind when it is windy. The combination of high capital costs and low utilization leads to high electricity prices. Because of their transient nature and variability of weather conditions, solar and wind energy cannot be used as base power and are largely utilized in sophisticated grids where there are backup natural gas or coal powered plants that can take up load on cloudy or windless days. Biomass power plants can operate 24 hours a day and can be used as base power.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Biomass electricity is cost-effective and practical, and it offers a realistic and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Biomass is versatile and can be used to produce bio-methane to replace natural gas, liquid biofuels to replace gasoline and diesel fuel, and as a feedstock to produce biochemicals and bioplastics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 4:<span>&nbsp; </span>The speed at which Giant King Grass matures as regrowth is astounding. What is the basis for this amazing increase in productivity in the second and succeeding years?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We at VIASPACE call Giant King Grass &quot;the new biomass for green energy&quot;. <a href="../giant_king_grass_info.php">Giant King Grass</a> is a very fast growing, high yield, hybrid grass that is neither genetically modified nor invasive. It grows in a variety of soil conditions and does not compete with food crops. Giant King Grass is perennial and it is a short rotation crop that can be harvested in the first year, compared to other crops that have much lower yields and cannot be harvested until their second, third or fourth year of growth. Regrowth is significantly faster than the initial harvest because the plant establishes an excellent root system. Once GKG has been established, it can be harvested at 3-5 feet tall for biogas production every 45 to 60 days. For other applications such as power plant fuel, pellets or biofuels, it is harvested at 13-16 feet tall every 150-180 days. This high rate of growth of GKG can provide a continual supply of biomass year-round. With competitive energy characteristics combined with multiple harvests per year, the energy output or energy yield of GKG per acre per year is much higher than other grasses. As a result, GKG cultivation offers material productivity benefits and therefore lower cost biomass for energy production, biofuels and biomaterials.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 5:<span>&nbsp; </span>It is our understanding that one of the major uses of biomass is to help co-fire coal plants and reduce their carbon emission footprint. How does that work and why is that useful?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Burning coal and biomass together is called co-firing and requires only a small modification to coal burning power plants. Coal fired power plants represent huge capital investments and this concept preserves and extends those capital investments for many years to come. Giant King Grass can be pelletized and those <a href="../giant_king_grass_pellets.php">pellets</a> can be co-fired with coal to reduce the net carbon dioxide emissions or carbon footprint of coal-fired electricity production. This helps meet carbon reduction targets and can replace up to 20% of coal in existing coal-fired power plants. We grow the GKG, it&#39;s harvested, dried, pressed into pellets and shipped in bulk like shipping grain. In other words, GKG becomes a bio-commodity like shipping coal or fuel, only it&#39;s continuously renewable green energy! There are 16 million tons of pellets used globally today and estimates are that increases to 46 million tons by 2020. There is a growing global demand for pellets, particularly in Europe, Korea, China and Japan is also emerging.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 6:<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you believe that VIASPACE is poised to become a major player in the emerging green energy sector and why will that happen?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The answer is a resounding <strong>YES</strong> because our proprietary product, Giant King Grass, is not just any plant or species of grass; it is the highest yielding dedicated energy crop in the world. We call it a continuously renewable, bioenergy <strong>platform. </strong>As a dedicated biomass, bioenergy platform, it can take you in a multitude of directions depending on your industrial purpose for green energy. When developed and grown and used to its full potential--it is a global, green energy game changer--an enabling technology for bioelectricity that is nearly as competitive as coal in price (which is the least expensive fossil fuel when locally available), but is overall carbon neutral. More importantly, it can be used as I said for a biomass platform for numerous applications such as:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">1) Direct combustion in electric power generation/heat/steam</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">2) Pellets for co-firing with coal</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">3) Biogas/anaerobic digestion to create electricity with fertilizer as a byproduct</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">4) Cellulosic liquid biofuels--ethanol/butanol</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">5) Biochemical and bioplastics</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">6) Pyrolysis to bio oil</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">7) Catalytic conversion to biodiesel</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">8) Torrefaction to biocoal</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">9) Pulp for paper and textiles</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Some of these applications are commercially used today with agricultural and forestry waste and Giant King Grass can be used instead as a continuous, high-yielding feedstock. Giant King Grass will allow future commercialization of some of these applications because its high yield and low cost will make these processes reliable and profitable. We at VIASPACE know the science and practical application of our product, Giant King Grass, inside and out and we can work with our customers and partners to rapidly succeed in using this renewable, biomass platform approach to green energy production. VIASPACE works on integrated plantation and bioenergy, pellet or biorefinery projects and we are seeking qualified project opportunities. We will work with partners, project developers or act as a project developer. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 7:<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span></strong><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal"><a href="../press_article.php?id=1390"><strong>January 14</strong></a></span></strong><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">, you announced that Giant King Grass is growing in Hawaii. Tell us about your plans there.</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">One of our biggest announcements in <a href="../press_article.php?id=1377">2012</a> was that Giant King Grass had been approved by the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> and had been released from quarantine by the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (<a href="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/about_aphis/">APHIS</a>) for distribution in the United States. Hawaii, however, has additional plant import rules, and Giant King Grass is being grown in a facility under the purview of the <a href="http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/">Hawaii Department of Agriculture</a>. Our CEO, Dr. Kukkonen, personally supervised the planting in Hawaii and met with Hawaiian Department of Agriculture officials as well as with potential Giant King Grass customers in Hawaii. It takes 12 months for the Hawaii Department of Agriculture&#39;s review and analysis of Giant King Grass to be completed and that clock started ticking for VIASPACE and its shareholders in December of 2012. Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the United States ranging from $0.30--$0.40 per kilowatt hour (two to three times the cost of electricity on the US mainland) depending on the cost of oil. Using Giant King Grass as the biomass platform, VIASPACE and its partners in Hawaii can generate bioelectricity substantially cheaper than oil generated electricity and greatly reduce carbon emissions in the process. We know for certain that GKG will grow perfectly well and thrive in the Hawaiian climate and there are large tracts of land previously used for sugar cane and pineapple. We believe that co-locating biomass electric plants on Hawaii with Giant King Grass plantations could also serve as a green energy tourist attraction and increase the global visibility and profile of green, clean energy production. The VIASPACE clock is ticking in Hawaii and we are looking forward to playing a role in Hawaii&#39;s green energy future.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 8:<span>&nbsp; </span>On January 28, you announced that you are growing Giant King Grass in South Africa. Can you tell us about the significance of that project?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We are partnering with <a href="../press_article.php?id=1391">Selectra</a> of Johannesburg, South Africa, and Selectra is a leading developer of sustainable bioenergy projects in Africa. Selectra approached VIASPACE, seeking out Giant King Grass as a dedicated energy crop and they are considering using Giant King Grass for both biogas and direct combustion power plants. Our relationship with Selectra in South Africa is exciting for many reasons. One proof of concept was the actual exporting of Giant King Grass seedlings from our California nursery to South Africa. Selectra obtained an import permit from the South African government and that permit required stringent inspection and treatment prior to overseas shipment. U.S. agriculture officials inspected the VIASPACE nursery in California and witnessed the treatment or our GKG seedlings required by South Africa and then issued a phytosanitary certificate. Our CEO, Dr. Kukkonen traveled with the seedlings and supervised the first planting in South Africa. We are gaining valuable experience at shipping GKG seedlings from our California propagation nursery to anywhere on the globe while meeting strict import and export criteria specific to the global destination.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As you know, gold mining is a multibillion dollar business in South Africa and there are large tracts of land affected by mining there. For example, gold mining produces large amounts of ore from which gold has been extracted. There are thousands of acres of mine tailings that have been left behind after the gold has been extracted. These mine tailings need to be reclaimed as useful land. Selectra has grown beets and sorghum on mine tailings, but these are annual crops that have to be replanted every year. Giant King Grass is a perennial crop that does not require replanting every year and is a candidate crop to remediate mine tailings through the process of <strong><span style="font-weight: normal"><a href="http://www.epa.gov/superfund/accomp/news/phyto.htm"><strong>phytoremediation</strong></a></span></strong> which removes heavy metals from the soil and returns organic matter into the mine tailings to make the soil useful again. Giant King Grass is fast growing and has a great supporting root system. If successful in this important test, Giant King Grass will have found an amazing dual purpose of remediating mine-affected land while simultaneously providing the world&#39;s highest yielding biomass platform for green electricity production. The climate in <a href="http://www.southafrica.info/travel/advice/climate.htm">South Africa</a> is good and we are also growing GKG on mine affected land adjacent to mine tailings--we are confident that GKG will grow well in that setting. Lastly, having our product growing in South Africa has opened the &quot;VIASPACE door&quot; on the African Continent and we are now in talks in other African nations about projects using Giant King Grass as a dedicated energy crop.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 9: On February 20, you announced that VIASPACE has a contract with Agricorp and is growing Giant King Grass in Nicaragua. What is different about this relationship and why should investors take notice?</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE has been working on its business relationship with <a href="http://www.agricorp.com.ni/">Agricorp</a> under a confidentiality agreement since July of 2011. Agricorp is a subsidiary of Grain Hill which is a diversified agro-industrial business group with revenues of $300 million per year with operations in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and El Salvador. For example, Grain Hill/Agricorp is the largest rice company in Nicaragua with 65% of the market share there. Agricorp is the &quot;real deal&quot; with regards to their financial strength, their regional outreach, their motivation to generate their own bioelectricity and their demonstrated agricultural expertise. Giant King Grass seedlings were shipped from our California nursery and planted on part of a 10,000 acre Agricorp farm near Lake Nicaragua. An Agricorp rice mill is co-located on that farm which would also be the site of a co-located biomass electric power plant. Giant King Grass will be the primary fuel for the power plant and supplemented by rice husks as the rice is routinely harvested. In parallel with the Giant King Grass biomass plantation, VIASPACE and Agricorp will also partner together in the power plant development. This is the perfect business relationship that we have been seeking in that we are not only providing the high-yielding biomass fuel but we are also sharing in the power plant development and its continuous revenue stream. The Agricorp team understands agriculture and we are excited to grow Giant King Grass with them because we believe that they will rapidly discover and experience the economic benefits of GKG as world&#39;s highest yielding biomass platform and the revenues that can be generated. Investors should recognize that we have a financially strong and able partner in Agricorp and our relationship with them has been revealed at a time when we are both ready to move forward with our plans to establish a premier Central America biomass power plant and then continue to grow our business with them from there.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Question 10: Kevin, I realize that you do not have a crystal ball to predict the future; however, could you tell us where management would like to see VIASPACE&#39;s share price at this time next year? Please give our listeners a compelling reason why they should make VSPC a part of their investment portfolio.</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Answer: </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As <a href="../au_boards.php">Chairman of the Board</a> of the company, I think it would be unwise to make a specific share price prediction. But I would strongly encourage the investment community to consider and review the sheer pace of VIASPACE&#39;s progress since becoming a free-standing company on October 1, 2012 with the worldwide license to market Giant King Grass outside of China and Taiwan. Since October 1, 2012, we have announced that we are growing Giant King Grass in Southern California, <a href="../press_article.php?id=1383">St. Croix USVI</a>, South Africa, Hawaii, Nicaragua, and <a href="../press_article.php?id=1379">Myanmar</a>. We are in confidential talks with other new clients here in the Southern United States, Africa, India, the Philippines, the Middle East and South America. We are the known experts in using our proprietary product, GKG, as the highest yielding biomass platform in the world. We have the know how and ability to ship our Giant King Grass seedlings from our California nursery to any destination in the world. The established high yield of GKG is crucial to make biomass electricity competitive and affordable. Banks and investors will not finance biomass power plants without a long-term fuel supply contract. Giant King Grass provides a reliable, well-documented, consistent quality fuel supply or feedstock with a predictable, affordable price. Our customers actually save money by paying VIASPACE a license fee for high-yielding GKG as opposed to using a lower yielding naturally occurring biomass source. We are moving fast to make deals happen across the globe and are totally focused on the various commercial applications of Giant King Grass as the world&#39;s premier <strong>platform dedicated energy crop</strong> for bioelectricity, biomass pellets, biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">I became Chairman of the Board of VIASPACE after purchasing 100,000,000 VSPC common shares on the open market and since that time have provided additional financial support to the company in the form of convertible loans. I have immediately converted those loans to an additional 36,000,000 VSPC common shares, and by converting to these shares have purposely kept additional debt off our balance sheet. Our total share count is about 1.4 billion and VIASPACE insiders (me included) hold nearly half those shares. I am the Chairman of the company and the greatest advocate of the common shareholders because I view myself as a common shareholder. I have previously gone on record to reassure our shareholders that I would not ever support a reverse split unless we are growing so fast that we need a reverse split to take the financial advantages of moving to a higher exchange. Where else can you buy a stock at our current price of $0.015 per share to own a company that has a transformational green energy platform product that is being so rapidly rolled out and implemented on literally a global basis? Once we start generating continuous organic revenues from our harvest-by-harvest Giant King Grass license fees and by selling electricity through our power plant partnerships, the opportunity to purchase our stock at these prices will be a distant memory. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe commented, &quot;The interview with CEONEWS.Tv represented another great opportunity to get the compelling business story of VIASPACE out to a wider audience of new investors. We want the investment community to recognize that we see ourselves, not as a penny stock issue, but as a multinational company that represents the future of dedicated, renewable, green bioenergy. We are just now scratching the surface of our huge potential and we are continuously working with new clients who are catching our vision that high-yielding Giant King Grass represents a paradigm shift in the economics of industrial green energy. I invite serious green energy investors to consider taking a position in VIASPACE to actively follow and participate in our growth and future.&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

Previously, the company announced that it had signed a project agreement and received funding from Selectra CC of Johannesburg, South Africa, and that Giant King Grass was delivered and planted in South Africa.</span></span><br /><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The first project for Selectra is to remediate and also produce energy on land that has been altered by gold mining in South&nbsp;Africa. Mining is a very large industry in Africa, and there are numerous large tracts of mine affected lands. For example, gold mining produces large amounts of ore from which the gold has been extracted. There are thousands of hectares of these &quot;mine dumps&quot; or more correctly stated, slimes dams and mine tailings (the footprint that remains after a slimes dam has been removed for further processing).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The slimes dams are composed primarily of crushed rock that has been processed to remove the gold. It is not suitable soil and has minimal organic matter. There are traces of chemicals and contaminants from the gold processing. The mining companies are responsible for ensuring that these contaminants do not enter into the groundwater or are transported outside the dam itself by wind or erosion. They must maintain these slimes dams indefinitely until they are no longer a hazard.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass was planted on the slimes dams to evaluate its performance in this difficult environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass can be used as a windbreak to prevent dust from spreading and to prevent soil erosion. The subsurface root system will add organic matter and help create soil from the crushed rock. The Giant King Grass may take up heavy metal contaminants from the slimes dams and contribute to remediation. Food crops are not possible because of the contamination in the soil.<span>&nbsp;</span>Selectra&#39;s goal is to use the Giant King Grass as a feedstock for either anaerobic digestion or direct combustion to produce electricity and therefore create value from these slimes dams for themselves and their partner gold mining company.<span>&nbsp; </span>It may be possible to remove<br />the heavy metal contaminants from the anaerobic digestate as well.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Selectra </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Commercial Director Dwight Rosslee reports, &quot;Giant King Grass is growing well on the slimes footprint and we are pleased with the results so far.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are entering a critical phase of the tests as we need to model plant growth during our winter months and the early signs are most encouraging as the plants have continued to grow under the frost covers. In this regard we have extended the trial to December 2013 and thereby having almost 12 months data.&quot;<span>&nbsp; </span>Rosslee attributes the success of the trials to Giant King Grass&#39; unique properties coupled with Selectra&#39;s proprietary soil treatments - &quot;the slimes footprint where the tests are taking place are very unhospitable towards crop establishment with just about no organic loading, no nutrients and is acidic with an average pH of 4.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Rosslee continued, &quot;The tests on the tailings are extremely important as Giant King Grass could become our preferred crop on the tailings dams to get the biomass yields we are seeking. Moreover, the tailings dam applications outside of bioenergy are exciting as they are extremely varied from wind breaks, erosion prevention, and dust suppression to land remediation. In addition we will conduct scientific tests to gauge the ability of the plant to take up heavy metals and other contaminants typically found in mine impacted land.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"> </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">We are optimistic regarding our test results thus far and our goal is to use this data to support building biomass power plants to generate electricity from the Giant King Grass.&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented: &quot;Selectra is a leading developer of sustainable bioenergy projects in Africa. They are considering both biogas and direct combustion biomass power plants, both of which we have conclusively demonstrated that Giant King Grass is the ideal biomass platform to support. Our mutual goal is for VIASPACE and Selectra to join forces and work together on power plant projects. We at VIASPACE are very<br />pleased that Giant King Grass is now a leading candidate to be used simultaneously to reclaim gold mine affected lands through the process of<br />phytoremediation and then be continuously harvested to create bioelectricity.<br />This is a classic win-win situation of job creation in putting local farmers to<br />work, providing an environmentally sound and green method to restore mine<br />tailings, and in the process, generate carbon neutral electricity for local homes<br />and businesses.

According to a joint press release from WAPA and Tibbar, the St. Croix based woman owned renewable energy company, will generate and sell to the utility seven (7) megawatts (MW) of base load power generated from Giant King Grass. Tibbar will average savings below WAPA&#39;s avoided cost which is the amount WAPA would spend to produce the same amount of energy using oil as it does today.</span><br /><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tania Tomyn, Tibbar Energy Chief Executive Officer (CEO), said &quot;We look forward to supplying renewable energy at a lower cost to the people and businesses of St. Croix.&quot;<span>&nbsp;</span>Tibbar&#39;s process will consist of growing Giant King Grass, a non-invasive, USDA approved agricultural energy crop on 1,500 acres which will then be fed to the anaerobic digestion facility. The naturally occurring biological process of anaerobic digestion creates bio-gas which is then fed into biogas generators to generate the 7 MW of power that will be sold to the local utility. </span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tomyn continued, &quot;This Power Purchase Agreement approval is a major milestone for our company, and having Giant King Grass as a reliable, dedicated feedstock for our anaerobic digester is key to our project. We first met VIASPACE two years ago and decided to explore Giant King Grass and we found it was the right energy crop after being involved with the California<br />nursery and testing. We signed a contract with them in 2012. We have been<br />successfully growing Giant King Grass on St. <span style="font-size: 12pt">Croix </span><span style="font-size: 12pt">since October 2012. I want to thank VIASPACE for its technical support.&quot;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The project will be built and generating power by June 2015, as required by the PPA with WAPA, Tomyn said. Tibbar Energy is working with Layne Heavy Civil, Inc. based in Mission Woods, KS, one of North America&#39;s largest waste water treatment engineering, construction and procurement contractors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Layne has a strategic partnership with entec biogas gmbh of Austria which has built over 100 biogas plants worldwide. Layne specializes in project and schedule guaranteed projects.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most of the preliminary design has been completed over the last year by Layne and entec.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">WAPA Executive Director, Hugo V. Hodge, Jr. said that the utility is excited to be part of a project using cutting edge technology, the first of its kind in the Caribbean region. &quot;This project is very compatible with our energy road map, the energy production action plan issued by the Authority&#39;s Governing Board last year and Governor John P. DeJongh&#39;s mandate to reduce the use of fossil fuel in the territory 60% by 2025,&quot; Hodge said. &quot;We are on our way to offering definite relief to our customers from the high rates primarily attributed to our 100% dependency on fossil fuel to make power and water,&quot; said Hodge.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Anaerobic digestion mimics the process in a cow&#39;s stomach to produce bio methane (a naturally occurring biological process) which is then used in an engine generator set to produce clean renewable and low carbon electricity. The byproduct of anaerobic digestion is organic fertilizer which will be put back<br />on the Giant King Grass fields. <span>&nbsp;</span>Anaerobic digestion is an extremely mature technology. Many thousands of anaerobic digestion power plants are in operation in Europe providing electricity to 3 million homes in Germany<br />alone.</span>&nbsp;</p><br /><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Giant King Grass can be used in power plants to produce high-pressure steam that turns a turbine to produce 10 to 35 MW of electricity, or as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion power plants. The VIASPACE project in Nicaragua is a 12 MW plant using Giant King Grass.&nbsp;</span><br /><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;Our congratulations go to Tibbar. Together we are pioneers in clean renewable energy in the Caribbean, and this project is a major step forward. You hear a lot about solar and wind energy and they have a significant role to play. But solar and wind are intermittent energy and can only play a marginal role because there is no way to store electricity on a large scale. Tibbar&#39;s project is base load power and integral to the islands grid.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen continued, &quot;VIASPACE has licensed the Giant King Grass to Tibbar and will receive license fee revenue for the duration of the 25 year Power Purchase Agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of its very high yield, Giant King Grass is a lower cost feedstock for Tibbar then other alternative feedstocks. Tibbar gets a reliable and well-characterized feedstock and saves money by paying the license fee to VIASPACE. The people of St. Croix get reliable clean electricity at a substantially lower cost than they are paying today. They also create jobs for<br />their people and the money stays on St. Croix instead of going overseas to pay for oil. The planet gets lower carbon emissions. This is a unique win - win - win - win situation, and this is the model that VIASPACE is pursuing around the globe. We plan to replicate this model and build many Giant King Grass plantations integrated with power plants-- thus providing low cost, clean and renewable electricity for our customers and profits for our investors. <span>&nbsp;</span>We welcome inquiries from other countries and regions that can benefit from Giant King Grass based electricity today and from biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials in the future.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;We are extremely proud to be working with Tibbar Energy on St. Croix with this technologically-modern, carbon-neutral, green energy, 7MW anaerobic digestion power plant. VIASPACE Giant King Grass is the highest yielding, continuously renewable, biomass platform in the world and it is the perfect solution for the energy needs of tropical island nations or countries that depend on imported oil to create base power for local electricity. We at VIASPACE are very busy making the effort to show the world a new concept called: &lsquo;Growing Your Electricity&#39;. We believe that, in the very near future, people from around the world will look at our projects in St. Croix and Nicaragua and recognize that they were the forerunners of a new wave of carbon neutral, continuously renewable, clean energy production that is second only to coal in cost effectiveness but carries the larger benefit of carbon neutrality. From a global benefit perspective, in lieu of using fossil fuels, every one of our future projects will have a positive<br />impact on global warming.

(OTCQB: VSPC) today<br />announced that it will present options for clean, renewable, biomass power<br />plants fueled by Giant King Grass to U.S. Department of Defense officials and<br />to representatives of islands and isolated communities at the Asia Pacific<br />Clean Energy Summit to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii on September 9-11, 2013. The Summit program includes U.S. Department of Defense Opportunities and Programs, and the Summit is held jointly with the Islands and Isolated Communities Congress. VIASPACE will exhibit at the Defense Energy and Islands Solutions Showcase.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen reports that: &quot; &lsquo;Grow Your Own Electricity&#39;, the VIASPACE slogan that summarizes our approach, is directly applicable to many U.S. military bases and to islands and isolated communities that need clean, reliable and renewable electricity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of these bases and islands depend on imported oil to produce their electricity. Not only is oil expensive and is associated with high carbon dioxide emissions, the logistics of delivering oil is complicated and has the potential of interruption during military conflict.<span>&nbsp; </span>Protecting the oil supply lines also requires significant military forces.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">In addition to the security benefits of &quot;Growing Your Own Electricity&quot;, a Giant King Grass fueled power plant is responsive to the Defense Authorization Act of 2007 which was enacted under a Republican administration and Republican Congress that mandated that the military &quot;produce or procure not less than 25 percent of the total electric energy it consumes during FY2025 and thereafter from renewable energy sources.&quot; This policy has been continued under the current Democratic administration and appears to have strong bipartisan support.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;A biomass power plant provides reliable, 24/7, clean and renewable electricity and complements the intermittent electricity from solar and wind. Biomass can be grown on or near the military base or island and stockpiled for security. It can be used day or night to produce electricity.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, Giant King Grass is a tropical and subtropical biomass platform that is not suitable for freezing climates and requires sufficient rainfall or irrigation. Therefore it is an ideal solution for places like Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the<br />southern U.S. and other warm regions or tropical island locations. In these areas, Giant King Grass can be a very attractive solution to providing green electricity at a fraction of the cost of diesel fuel or bunker oil.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">As an example, consider the state of Hawaii which has the highest electricity rates of any U.S. state because their electricity is mostly generated from imported oil. Hawaii electric rates range from $0.30 - $0.40 per kilowatt hour depending on the cost of oil. This is two or three times the cost of electricity on the U.S. mainland.<span>&nbsp; </span>Giant King Grass produced electricity would be much less expensive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen reports, &quot;There are two reliable ways to generate electricity from Giant King Grass. You can use direct combustion or anaerobic digestion which produces biogas. Direct combustion power plants for Giant King Grass range in size from 7.5 MW to 35 MW. Anaerobic digestion power plants are suitable for smaller applications and range from approximately 0.5 MW to 7.0 MW.<span>&nbsp;</span>The Giant King Grass grown on 200 acres of land can produce enough fuel for a 1 MW biogas power plant.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is enough electricity to provide essential electrical services of lighting, television and a small refrigerator for more than 6,000 families in a remote community.<span>&nbsp; </span>Growing the Giant King Grass also provides local community jobs bringing additional benefits to the local economy.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For a military base with air conditioning and a lot of electronic equipment, the electricity use will be larger and require a larger biomass power plant. If the base or the neighboring community has the land and water for growing Giant King Grass, this may be a very good option.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Previously VIASPACE announced that Giant King Grass has been released from quarantine by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for distribution in the United&nbsp;States.<span>&nbsp;</span>Hawaii,<br />however, has additional plant import rules, and the Giant King Grass is being<br />grown in a facility under the purview of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen reports, &quot;Giant King Grass is growing well in the quarantine facility in Hawaii. It is in a screened room with a translucent roof to let in a little sun. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture staff waters Giant King Grass on our schedule. They now report that the Giant King Grass has grown very tall and is hitting the roof which is over 12 feet high. We soon plan to cut the Giant King Grass and let it regrow.<span>&nbsp; </span>By the end of the quarantine period in December this year, it should be hitting the ceiling again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass is grown at the VIASPACE nursery in California which has been inspected by the Department of Agriculture. The process for obtaining Giant King Grass to grow in a foreign country is for that country to issue an import permit that lists the inspections and any treatment requirements under their regulations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture inspects the Giant King Grass and supervises any required treatment and then issues a phytosanitary certificate that accompanies the shipment from California and it is presented to the authorities in the importing country.<span>&nbsp; </span>With this process, the U.S. Department of Agriculture certifies the Giant King Grass is safe and does not present any pest or disease problems to the importing country.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kevin Schewe, VIASPACE Chairman, concluded: &quot;Giant King Grass has been successfully exported to and is growing in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, Nicaragua in Central America, South&nbsp;Africa and to other countries. We at<br />VIASPACE are extremely busy at this time meeting with new and existing<br />international and U.S. clients and simultaneously examining the expansion of our core business model and platform approach to using Giant King Grass. With its impressive high yield per acre of land and rapidly growing body of third party testing data, we believe that we are just now &lsquo;scratching the surface&#39; of the total, potential economic value of Giant King Grass. We are committed to show the world that you can &lsquo;Grow Your Electricity&#39; and use Giant King Grass as an incredibly versatile biomass platform for green, renewable economic growth.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a<br />feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels,<br />biochemicals and biomaterials.

(1409, 'High Protein Animal Feed Is New Large Market for VIASPACE Giant King Grass', '', '<span style="font-size: 11pt">August 20, 2013 - Walnut, California - <span style="color: black">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today<br />announced results of independent and third-party testing that shows that Giant<br />King Grass when it is cut frequently at 4-5 feet tall is an excellent high protein animal feed. The average protein content of five samples was 14.3% with good energy content and digestibility. The results show that Giant King Grass is much better than wheat straw, corn straw, sorghum silage, Bermuda grass or Sudan grass. It is very similar in nutritional value to oat hay.</span></span><br /><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass can be used as freshly chopped animal feed, made into hay, silage or feed pellets. Giant King Grass can feed cattle, dairy cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs and some chickens, turkeys, geese and fish.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The largest applications are to feed cattle and dairy cows. There is a large US<br />domestic market for animal feed, but very important export markets as well.<br />According to the US Department of Agriculture, 109 million metric tons of hay were produced in the US in 2012 and the average domestic selling price for hay was $200 per metric ton. California, Oregon and Washington which are close to seaports provide 95% of the exported hay-- less than 4% of US&nbsp; production-- at an average price of $280 per metric ton. Long Beach in California is the most active port. The largest export customers are Japan,<br />South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and China.&nbsp;Previously, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia provided expensive desalinated water to farmers to locally grow animal feed for their domestic use. They are stopping this practice and are importing hay from the US, Australia, Spain and any other source available. China, Japan and Korea are increasing the amount of dairy&nbsp;in their diets and this leads to higher hay imports. The US Department of<br />Agriculture reports that the 2012 hay export market was $1.2 billion and projects the export demand to grow significantly.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen states, &quot;Giant King Grass was developed as a dedicated energy crop to grow very quickly and tall--14 to 16 feet tall every six months-- and to be used as fuel or feedstock for electricity generation, biofuels and biochemicals.<span>&nbsp; </span>However for anaerobic digestion to make biogas electricity, the grass is harvested fresh at 4-5 feet tall every 45-60 days. The results for biogas production from Giant King Grass are very good. We realized that because anaerobic digestion mimics the process in a cow&#39;s stomach, Giant King Grass should be good animal feed as well. Several samples of Giant King Grass were sent to be tested by the Dairy One Forage Laboratory which is an international leader in forage and feed analysis. They also have an extensive database to compare different forage crops. The results for Giant King Grass are very good. A potential customer also came to our Giant King Grass nursery in California and obtained a sample for independent testing including in vitro digestibility. The results confirmed the data from Dairy One. Giant King Grass is a good animal feed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;If lower yielding and lower quality grasses can be grown profitably in California, then higher yielding Giant King Grass can be also grown profitably in California for domestic animal feed and for export.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Furthermore, VIASPACE also plans to explore growing Giant King Grass in lower cost locations such as Southeast Asia for export to Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan.<span>&nbsp; </span>The markets in United&nbsp; Arab Emirates and Saudi&nbsp; Arabia can be addressed from Giant King Grass plantations in Southeast Asia or East Africa. A Giant King Grass plantation for animal feed can be quickly established with low capital expenses compared to a power plant.&quot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, concluded: &quot;Animal feed is a new, exciting and very large market for Giant King Grass from VIASPACE. We have been working on the concept of using Giant King Grass for animal feed for some time now, but did not want to &lsquo;confuse&#39; our investor audience since we are a &lsquo;bioenergy&#39; company. Power plant investors want to be absolutely certain that there is enough Giant King Grass for their power plant. This conservatism leads to a larger Giant King Grass (GKG) plantation than is actually required and using the &lsquo;extra&#39; GKG for animal feed increases the profitability of the plantation. We now have a way to create significant additional value for our bioenergy customers. For example, Giant King Grass could be used as animal feed during the time that a GKG plantation is being propagated and developed to fuel a biomass power plant. Furthermore, we intend to use Giant King Grass as animal feed to greatly expand and accelerate our revenue stream creating yet another way to make our company business model more profitable. We are making this announcement simultaneously while we are in negotiations with new clients who are focused on using Giant King Grass for animal feed projects. Our constant goal is to grow our company and the recognized platform uses of Giant King Grass to create revenue and value for our shareholders.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a<br />feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels,<br />biochemicals and biomaterials.

(1410, 'VIASPACE CEO Update Highlights Recent Business Activities and Opportunities', '', '<span style="font-size: 11pt">September 4, 2013 - Walnut, California - <span style="color: black">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, today provided an update on recent company business activities occurring since June. This update covers a portion of the activities and another update will be forthcoming.</span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen stated, &quot;I spent two weeks in Nicaragua working on the 12 MW Giant King Grass power plant project with AGRICORP--our partner and the largest rice company in Nicaragua. The planned project will be fueled by 2,100 acres of Giant King Grass growing on AGRICORP property and irrigated from Lake Nicaragua. The Giant King Grass is growing well in Nicaragua. The original shipment of Giant King Grass reached maturity and was then propagated into a larger area. It is growing better and faster than it grows in<br />California--which is really quite amazing. For example, the plants that we initially cut have regrown to 5-6 feet tall in just 25 days. The power plant is planned to be co-located on the same property as the Giant King Grass plantation. Later this summer, I also met with our power plant partner. We have complete specifications and a full financial model for the power plant and the Giant King Grass plantation. AGRICORP and I met with international development banks in Washington, D.C. and received an excellent reception for our project. Our overall project is progressing nicely with AGRICORP and Giant King Grass is thriving in Nicaragua.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;The excellent results on Giant King Grass as animal feed are a major VIASPACE Company highlight of the summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Independent third-party and customer testing have confirmed that Giant King Grass has both high nutrition value and good digestibility for feeding animals. The protein content ranged from 13.5% to 15.6% of dry matter. One analysis suggested that Giant King Grass is comparable to oat hay which is in very high demand, and Giant King Grass has almost twice as much protein as oat hay. A single harvest of Giant King Grass has a much higher yield than oat hay, and Giant King Grass is a perennial plant that can be harvested every 60 days for years before replanting is needed. <span>&nbsp;</span>This saves customers a lot of money thus making the business proforma modeling more attractive to potential clients.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a huge domestic market for feeding cattle, dairy cows and other animals, and the U.S. West Coast exports a lot of forage to Japan, Korea and the Middle East. The animal feed market represents a major and immediate business opportunity for Giant King Grass. The price paid for baled oat hay is $120 - $160 per U.S. ton which means that Giant King Grass can be profitably grown as animal feed here in the U.S. and in other countries. We are in serious discussions with several potential partners on commercially using Giant King Grass as animal feed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;Another highlight of the summer is that Mr. Khurram Irshad has been elected to the VIASPACE Board of Directors. Mr. Irshad is working on both power plant and animal feed applications of Giant King Grass. One specific target is Mr.<br />Irshad&#39;s native Pakistan. He now lives in California and is pursuing opportunities in the U.S. and other countries as well. I am happy to have him on board as an active Director who is working on projects for VIASPACE.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;I am traveling to Hawaii on Thursday, September 5<sup>th</sup>. Giant King Grass is growing in the final four months of required quarantine with the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. They informed me that the Giant King Grass has quite literally &lsquo;hit the ceiling&#39;. I will be cutting it and propagating it within the quarantine facility. I will also be meeting with potential customers and we will be exhibiting at the Defense Energy Challenge Technology Showcase which is part of the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Expo held in Honolulu,&nbsp; Hawaii on September 9-11, 2013.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;I will provide another CEO Update on Hawaii, Myanmar, Philippines, St. Croix, our nursery expansion test plot in California and other activities after I return.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;These are exciting times for VIASPACE and its shareholders. After years of stagnation during the economic downturn, it appears that biomass projects are now going forward.<span>&nbsp; </span>No project is able to successfully secure financing without having a guaranteed fuel or feedstock supply agreement. Giant King Grass allows you to reliably grow your own electricity and biofuels, and project developers are seeking us out.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, we are developing our own<br />projects with partners like AGRICORP and rapidly expanding our business line to use Giant King Grass as animal feed.

This second of three updates covers the Giant King Grass nursery in California and activities in Hawaii. It complements a previous company update issued on September 4, 2013.<span>&nbsp; </span>A future third CEO update will cover business activities and opportunities in Southeast Asia.</span></span><br /><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen reported, &quot;The VIASPACE Giant King Grass propagation nursery and test plot in California is ready to harvest for propagation material (Giant King Grass seedlings) to be sent to customers. The Giant King Grass was cut on March 10, 2013 and is now six months old. It is about 14 feet tall and is fully mature for propagation. We conducted a germination test at five months old and obtained 100% </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">germination which is outstanding.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;The nursery is also a demonstration plot that potential customers can visit to see the Giant King Grass in person.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although we show pictures of Giant King Grass and it can be seen on our website, seeing it in person reveals the full power and effect. The canopy is fully closed and when you walk inside, you cannot see the California sun. The closed canopy prevents weeds from growing amongst the Giant King Grass without the need for herbicide. The plants are racing each other to get to the sun and get very tall. During the last few months we have had visits from potential customers from Central America, the Caribbean, Philippines, India, Pakistan and the US.<span>&nbsp; </span>The nursery is not open to the public, but only to serious potential customers that have signed nondisclosure agreements.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;In addition, we recently announced results of independent and third-party testing that show when Giant King Grass is cut frequently at 4-5 feet tall, it is an excellent, high protein animal feed. The testing data demonstrate that Giant King Grass is very similar in nutritional value to oat hay. We have just recently expanded our California Giant King Grass nursery with additional land dedicated to further develop, implement and support our animal feed business line. This is an important new aspect of our overall business strategy to accelerate and augment our sources of revenue.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;Giant King Grass has been grown by the US Department of Agriculture and declared to be free of pest and disease, and approved for distribution throughout the United States, and for export to other countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>When Giant King Grass is exported, the US Department of Agriculture inspects the shipment at our California nursery and issues a phytosanitary certificate.<span>&nbsp;</span>Giant King Grass has been sent from our nursery in California to St. Croix in the U.S.Virgin Islands, Nicaragua, South Africa, Hawaii and to other locations.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;For those of you who have been to Hawaii, you will remember that there is a form that you have to fill out on the airplane declaring if you are carrying any agricultural items. This is because the Hawaiian Islands are very careful not to let in any new pests or invasive agricultural species. To get Giant King Grass into Hawaii, it has to be grown in their quarantine facility under supervision of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture for one year. It does not make any difference that the mainland USDA grew and approved Giant King Grass under their supervision, to get approval in Hawaii, it takes another year. VIASPACE made arrangements with the Hawaii Department of Agriculture and began growing Giant King Grass in quarantine on December 20, 2012.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;The quarantine facility is a one-story building surrounded by a water moat to prevent crawling insects from getting in. The door enters into a small vestibule painted black with another door admitting entry into the facility itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>This two step entrance process is meant to prevent flying insects from getting inside. Within the facility, there are separate rooms for each species. Our room is about 10&#39; x 13&#39; with a 13 foot ceiling that is a translucent plastic. Two sides are screened and air can get in. The room was sterilized and the Giant King Grass was planted in 5 gallon containers. The Department of Agriculture waters the plants according to our schedule, but does nothing else. VIASPACE does the maintenance including fertilization.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;It is not an ideal growing situation because there is no direct sunlight and only partial diffuse sunlight. This could significantly inhibit the growth of Giant King Grass. Secondly, Giant King Grass is supposed to be harvested twice per year whereas the quarantine is for a full year.<span>&nbsp; </span>Third, the grass is planted in 5 gallon containers rather than in the earth-- they are root bound. Despite these limitations, the Department of Agriculture notified us that the Giant King Grass was literally hitting the ceiling. Last week, I went and cut the grass and did a propagation of new Giant King Grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>The grass is doing well and there are no pests or disease.<span>&nbsp;</span>We expect that the Giant King Grass will be released from quarantine in three months on December 19, 2013. The seedlings from the Giant King Grass soon to be released from quarantine, represent the future of VIASPACE in Hawaii.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;While I was in Hawaii, I met with potential customers who are developing projects for biomass electricity. One important thing I learned was that the Hawaiian government is trying to resurrect the agriculture sector in Hawaii. There is only one operational sugar plantation remaining of the many great plantations of the past. Pineapple is virtually gone. At one time the Hawaiian&nbsp; Islands raised a great number of cattle and this business is almost gone as well. Pig farming is active, but declining. The food for the pigs is imported from the mainland which is very expensive. The few remaining cattle graze on pasture and then are sent to the cattle feed operations on the mainland to gain enough weight to be sold.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are many great opportunities for Giant King Grass to be used as animal feed and as an energy crop in Hawaii.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;I attended the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit and VIASPACE exhibited at the Expo. Hawaii Governor, Neil Abercrombie, gave the opening speech. He was very passionate and articulate about the need for renewable energy in Hawaii. He said that the electricity price of up to $0.40 per kilowatt hour was the highest of anywhere in the United States, and that Hawaii was totally dependent on expensive, imported oil. He specifically called out biomass electricity in addition to solar and wind as good alternatives for Hawaii. The Summit and Expo gave VIASPACE great exposure and produced several new leads and potential partnerships.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen concluded, &quot;Our propagation nursery and test plot in California is an extremely valuable asset. It is both a sales showroom and a source of Giant King Grass seedlings for customers interested in bioenergy projects and/or animal feed applications. Hawaii presents an exciting and new opportunity for VIASPACE as well and it is very timely that we entered quarantine last year. We will have Giant King Grass available to actively pursue and implement business opportunities in Hawaii in December.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a<br />feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels,<br />biochemicals and biomaterials.

(1412, 'VIASPACE and Maricopa Bio Crops Announce Giant King Grass Animal Feed Project in Arizona', '', '<span style="font-size: 11pt">September 24, 2013 - Walnut, California - <span style="color: black">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that the company has entered into a contract with Maricopa Bio Crops, LLC of Scottsdale, Arizona for a planned initial 4,500 acre Giant King Grass plantation to produce Giant King Grass hay for cattle feed in Arizona.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maricopa Bio Crops will grow and market the Giant King Grass under VIASPACE direction, and both companies will share the profits.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contract was signed on September 16, 2013 and VIASPACE received an initial payment from Maricopa.</span></span><br /><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Mr. Patrick Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Maricopa Bio Crops and Syn Tawa Energy, LLC stated, &quot;We are thrilled to be working with VIASPACE on this project. We have been carefully investigating bio crops in Arizona for both animal feed, and as dedicated energy crops for multiple biofuel projects that we are developing. Our Team has grown sorghum in Arizona as a baseline<br />energy crop; however, Giant King Grass has a much higher yield and is a<br />perennial crop that does not have to be replanted each year making it more<br />financially efficient and profitable. <span>&nbsp;</span>We have access to irrigated plantation land in Arizona to grow bio crops and the climate is suitable to grow Giant King Grass.&quot;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Mr. Sweeney continued, &quot;We met with VIASPACE CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, in May and visited the Giant King Grass nursery in California. When Dr. Kukkonen showed us the high protein animal feed data&nbsp;and results, we became very excited. However, we wanted to independently test Giant King Grass in our<br />laboratory. I personally cut the sample that we sent to our lab and it had<br />15.63% crude protein-- even better than previous results. Our livestock<br />nutritionist confirmed that Giant King Grass can be an important part of the<br />diet of cattle and dairy cows. We concluded that Giant King Grass hay can<br />provide a reliable and consistent source of quality forage feed for our<br />customers at an attractive price. Arizona has 900,000 cattle and 130,000 dairy cows and this represents a very large market for us. We are in the process of formalizing an initial agreement with one of the largest beef cattle rancher&#39;s in Arizona. Our phase one plan is to start with 4,500 acres to meet our obligations for our first customer of Giant King Grass and our goal is to triple that amount by expanding into two additional phases.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are currently in early discussions with multiple local Native American Tribes that could benefit tremendously by expanding their agricultural base with Giant King Grass. Moreover, our contract with VIASPACE also covers the potential future use of Giant King Grass for bio-refinery feedstock applications, as a backup feedstock source to our existing supplier&quot;.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;VIASPACE is truly excited to kick off our animal feed business with Maricopa Bio Crops,&quot; states CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen. &quot;They have been careful and thorough in their due diligence and we have come up with a business contract that is a win-win for both of us.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is an important step forward for our company and we will work closely with Maricopa to make phase one of the project successful and to then expand into phases two and three.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kevin Schewe, VIASPACE Chairman, commented, &quot;I have been closely following our negotiations with Maricopa Bio Crops and am very pleased that we have formalized<span>&nbsp; </span>this partnership. Animal feed is another great application for Giant King Grass and for VIASPACE. On August 20, 2013, we released results of independent testing that showed when Giant King Grass is cut frequently at 4-5 foot tall, it is an excellent, high protein animal feed. The results have shown that Giant King Grass is much better than wheat straw,<br />sorghum silage, corn straw, Bermuda grass or Sudan grass. It is very similar in<br />nutritional value to oat hay. The largest applications are to use Giant King<br />Grass to feed cattle and dairy cows which is exactly the plan in Arizona.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe continued, &quot;Historically, we have not disclosed projected revenue numbers for our anaerobic digestion and direct combustion power plant projects because of the financial complexity of these projects, competition reasons, and because of non-disclosure agreements. However, once we completed our own research and testing of Giant King Grass for animal feed&nbsp;we knew that the enormous domestic and global animal feed market represented a major and immediate business opportunity for VIASPACE and its shareholders. With Maricopa, we have a developed an animal feed business model that estimates profit sharing revenues to VIASPACE of $1.3 million per year for the initial phase one project and we are planning two additional phases. More importantly, animal feed projects (and the associated revenues/profits) can be executed and implemented more quickly than power plant projects and can also be complementary to the overall plans for bioenergy and biofuel projects.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe concluded, &quot;I believe that VIASPACE has reached its tipping point and our project with Maricopa starts now. We will strive every day to be an excellent partner in this endeavor with Maricopa Bio Crops, and our doors have opened to the new line of animal feed business both here in the U.S. and<br />abroad. We are working hard to move forward on all fronts to build endearing<br />value for our shareholders.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About Syn Tawa Energy, LLC and Maricopa<br />Bio Crops, LLC</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Syn Tawa Energy, LLC develops second generation Renewable Energy Refinery plants that combine a new, patented state-of-the-art, commercial scale, low emission cellulosic biomass gasifier with a highly efficient patented gas-to-diesel conversion system that generates premium sulfur free ASTM D-975 diesel fuel at a cost that is below first generation biodiesel and petroleum based diesel fuels.<span>&nbsp; </span>For more information go to <a href="http://www.syntawaenergy.com">www.syntawaenergy.com</a> or contact Patrick Sweeney at 949-887-6111.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Maricopa BioCrops, LLC grows renewable bio crops for animal feed and as a feedstock for biomass to liquid fuels production.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a<br />feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels,<br />biochemicals and biomaterials.

Selecta had previously&nbsp;grown sorghum and beets on the mine tailings, but those are annual crops.&nbsp;Giant King Grass is a perennial crop that does not require replanting&nbsp;every year and it also develops an extensive root system to deposit&nbsp;organic matter into the soil. The plan there is to take a major&nbsp;environmental problem and turn it into a major asset by using Giant King&nbsp;Grass for the dual purposes of remediating mine affected soil and then </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 11pt">building adjacent&nbsp;biomass&nbsp;power plants</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"> to generate electricity from Giant King Grass. On June 6, 2013 we updated the&nbsp;Selectra project in South Africa to report that Giant King Grass&nbsp;was growing well on the mine tailings and the trial project was extended&nbsp;to December 2013.&nbsp;We believe that Giant King Grass is now a leading&nbsp;candidate to be used simultaneously to reclaim gold mine affected lands&nbsp;through the process of phytoremediation and then continuously harvested to&nbsp;create bioelectricity.</span><br /> </p></li><li style="color: black; tab-stops: list .5in"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt">On February 20, 2013 VIASPACE announced our initial contract to grow Giant King Grass&nbsp;with Grain Hill/AGRICORP in&nbsp;Nicaragua, and then on May 21, 2013 we announced that VIASPACE and Grain&nbsp;Hill/AGRICORP signed a joint development agreement to build and operate a&nbsp;12MW power plant co-located with a 2,100 acre Giant King Grass plantation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and adjacent rice plantation on irrigated land near Lake Nicaragua.

We now have established two&nbsp;large&nbsp;lines of business for VIASPACE: animal feed and bioenergy production, AKA &#39;Growing Your Electricity&#39;. The domestic and international animal feed markets are already&nbsp;huge, growing in demand and represent an immediate and&nbsp;significant market and revenue source for VIASPACE and its shareholders. The current demand for&nbsp;animal feed represents a sales&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;of U.S. $300 billion worldwide and is projected to double&nbsp;by 2050. We can initiate and implement Giant King Grass&nbsp;animal feed projects any where in the world with suitable climate and irrigation/rainfall&nbsp;very quickly with lower capital costs than our power plant projects&nbsp;and generate significant revenue as we have disclosed in our Arizona animal feed&nbsp;project estimates. Our animal feed business line can serve as our immediate&nbsp;&quot;cash cow&quot; to generate money to grow our company and complement our plans for making Giant King Grass the world&#39;s premier dedicated bioenergy platform crop for bioelectricity, biomass pellets to co-fire with coal, biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics. We will pursue financing and build a sales team to continue to&nbsp;grow our two&nbsp;global&nbsp;business lines&nbsp;as our financing and revenues come to<br />fruition. We aspire to take the financial advantages of a higher stock exchange<br />(the global NASDAQ or NYSE) at the appropriate time in our growth curve.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our constant goal is to expand our domestic and global business&nbsp;footprint as rapidly as possible and become the recognized leader in green, renewable bioenergy and a new force in the large animal feed universe.&quot;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe concluded, &quot;I continue to view myself as a VIASPACE -(VSPC)&nbsp;common shareholder and the chief advocate for our&nbsp;common shareholders. I purchased 100,000,000 common VSPC shares on the open market prior to becoming the Chairman of the Board one year ago.

(OTCQB: VSPC) today<br />announced that its business partner, Maricopa Bio Crops, LLC of Scottsdale,<br />Arizona, has planted Giant King Grass in Arizona. VIASPACE harvested the Giant King Grass from its propagation nursery in California, and it was planted in southern Arizona on October 1, 2013. This is the first step in the planned initial 4,500 acre Giant King Grass plantation to produce Giant King Grass hay for cattle feed in Arizona. Two additional 4,500 acre phases are also planned.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maricopa Bio Crops will grow and market the Giant King Grass under VIASPACE direction, and both companies will share the profits. </span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Mr. Patrick Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Maricopa Bio Crops and Syn Tawa Energy, LLC stated, &quot;We are moving very quickly on this project. I was at the VIASPACE nursery for the harvest and VIASPACE CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, oversaw the planting in Arizona. We used mechanical planting to improve efficiency and reduce planting costs. Our land is irrigated from the Colorado River.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will initially use the Giant King Grass as animal feed and later as an energy crop for our biorefinery project. Our measured crude protein content of 15.63% shows that Giant King Grass is very nutritious, and our digestibility study showed great results. Giant King Grass hay and silage can provide a reliable and consistent source of quality forage feed for our customers at an attractive price. Arizona has 900,000 cattle and 130,000 dairy cows and this represents a very large market for us. We plan to be feeding cattle in 2014.&quot;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;It is a pleasure to be working with Maricopa Bio Crops,&quot; states CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen. &quot;They are very professional and their plan is very aggressive.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will fully support the project. I personally supervised the harvesting and preparation of the propagating material from our nursery in California, and I went to Arizona for the planting. The Maricopa Bio Crops project is our first animal feed plantation and we expect more to follow. There is a large domestic market for animal feed and also an export market to countries like Korea, Japan, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Animal feed projects can move forward very quickly and require less capital investment compared to energy projects. We will be pursuing both types of projects in parallel, and many energy projects will also produce animal feed.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;Our Arizona animal feed partnership contract with Maricopa Bio Crops was signed on September 13, 2013. We announced the details of our new partnership in a press release dated September 24, 2013. Today we are have announced that the VIASPACE Giant King Grass seedlings from our California nursery were planted in Arizona on October 1, 2013 under the joint supervision of VIASPACE and Maricopa Bio Crops, LLC. This first VIASPACE animal feed plantation partnership illustrates how nimble and quickly we can actually move to develop animal feed projects and our new animal feed business line. The current demand for animal feed represents a sales equivalent of U.S. $300 billion worldwide and is expected to double by 2050. We are now busy working with new clients to address that huge demand while simultaneously pursuing projects that use Giant King Grass as the world&#39;s highest-yielding, continually renewable, carbon-neutral, dedicated bioenergy platform crop for: bioelectricity, biomass pellets to co-fire with coal, biomass to liquid biofuels, biochemicals and bioplastics. We are diligently executing our business plan and rapidly expanding our footprint both here in the U.S. and abroad.

(1416, 'VIASPACE CEO Speaks by Invitation at Caribbean Renewable Energy Forum', '', '<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">October 15, 2013 - Walnut, California - <span style="color: black">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today<br />announced that CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, was an invited speaker at the fifth annual Caribbean Renewable Energy Forum held October 9th through October 11th in Aruba. Dr. Kukkonen represented biomass energy on a panel focused on biomass and waste to energy. He emphasized that &quot;growing your own electricity&quot; was an excellent option for reliable, green electricity in tropical and subtropical regions if there is sufficient land and water available. Kukkonen stated that with Giant King Grass, 200 acres are required for 1 MW of electricity. A 1 MW power plant is the smallest practical unit, and 35 MW using 7,000 acres of Giant King Grass is the largest.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">This respected forum brought together more than 500 participants from 42 countries to discuss renewable energy in the Caribbean region. More than a dozen ministers from the region participated in the forum which was kicked off by Aruba Prime Minister Mike Eman and Ambassador Albert Ramdin, the Assistant Secretary-General of the Organization of American States. Former President of Costa Rica, Jose Maria Figueres, chaired the plenary session.<span>&nbsp; </span>Financing organizations such as the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), Inter-American Development Bank, International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, commercial banks and private equity funds were represented.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;The conference was informative, well-attended by decision makers and VIASPACE made several important networking business connections,&quot; states CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen. &quot;Most of the countries represented at the conference produce their electricity from petroleum using heavy fuel oil or diesel. The resulting electricity sells for $0.35-$0.42 per kilowatt hour.<span>&nbsp; </span>Government officials from all of these countries decried this high price and are looking for<br />renewable, non-petroleum and lower cost electricity for their citizens. Many of<br />the countries rely heavily on tourism and being green is important to their tourist customers. A very noteworthy presentation was made by Sonia Miranda Vega of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. She described the challenges of integrating intermittent sources such as solar and wind into the grid of Puerto Rico which is an isolated island not connected to a larger grid. Her presentation emphasized that electricity cannot be stored and that the amount consumed must always equal the amount generated -- 24 hours a day, 365 days per year to have a stable system. Solar and wind are intermittent, and the grid system must have fast reacting backup generators that can take up the slack if clouds pass over a major solar facility. This fast reaction backup generation is a major concern, and a Puerto Rican energy panel concluded that only 15% of Puerto Rico&#39;s electricity generation can be provided by solar and wind. Giant King Grass and other biomass can be stored&nbsp;and produce reliable base electricity which is veryeasy to integrate on the grid.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;The Caribbean region has the suitable temperatures for growing Giant King Grass, but some of the small islands do not have enough land or water for significant agriculture including growing Giant King Grass. On the other hand, there are many larger island countries that are perfectly suitable for Giant King Grass. These include Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Dominican&nbsp;Republic, Haiti, St. Croix, Belize, Surinam and Guyana as well as some smaller islands.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had several meetings with representatives whose islands could support growing Giant King Grass. I was impressed that several of them had agricultural backgrounds and that Giant King Grass was very attractive to them.<span>&nbsp; </span>I believe this region will provide additional new business opportunities for VIASPACE.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;It was an honor for our company that Dr. Kukkonen was invited to speak at the Caribbean Renewable Energy Forum. It demonstrates how VIASPACE and Giant King Grass are now recognized as a viable, continuously renewable, carbon-neutral, non-petroleum electricity solution for tropical island locations that are motivated to free themselves of dependence on expensive fossil fuels. We are in the process of demonstrating how island nations can &quot;grow their electricity&quot; using Giant King Grass in our 7MW anaerobic digestor power plant project with Tibbar Energy on the island of St. Croix. In addition, our Giant King Grass is scheduled to be released from quarantine in Hawaii in two months on December 20, 2013 and we will then be available to start our business in Hawaii which should serve to establish our presence and green energy solutions for the Pacific island nations. We have a valuable new paradigm for green, renewable base electricity for tropical island nations.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen&#39;s presentation is on the VIASPACE website <a href="http://www.VIASPACE.com">www.VIASPACE.com</a>,<br />and pictures from the Caribbean Renewable Energy Forum are available on the<br />VIASPACE Facebook page </span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc" title="blocked::http://www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc">www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc</a>.</p><br /><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a<br />feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels,<br />biochemicals and biomaterials.

(OTCQB: VSPC) CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, today provided an update on recent company business activities in Asia and the Pacific region. It complements two previous company updates.</span></span><br /><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen reported, &quot;VIASPACE is pursuing several potential business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region including biomass power plants, biofuels and biochemicals, energy pellets and animal feed.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On some projects, we are acting as a project co-developer and on others we are the strategic biomass supplier.&quot;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;Giant King Grass is growing well in Myanmar and we are working on two opportunities there. The first is a 1 MW anaerobic digestion power plant that would serve as a model for replication throughout the country -- particularly in remote regions that are not served by the national grid. The second is a larger direct combustion power plant that would be connected to the national grid or to supply electricity to an industrial zone. The Myanmar government has indicated that the national grid does not have enough electricity to supply its growing industrial zones and they must arrange for their own electricity. Myanmar has a great need for electricity and has the perfect climate, land and farmers to grow Giant King Grass.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;On a recent trip, I met with our power plant partners that have extensive experience in delivering turnkey biomass power plants. With our partners, we can offer an integrated Giant King Grass plantation and co-located power plant that delivers reliable 24/7 clean electricity at half the cost of electricity generated from diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil. During that time, I also met with a group that is pursuing cellulosic biofuels and biochemicals in Malaysia.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen&nbsp;continued, &quot;A U.S. based company developing power plant projects in the South Pacific has engaged VIASPACE to do Giant King Grass site suitability evaluations for two power plants.<span>&nbsp; </span>Under a contract, the VIASPACE agronomist spent a week in a country located in the South Pacific with the development team. The site evaluation report is currently in progress. If the sites are suitable, we expect to proceed with a project contract. <span>&nbsp;</span>Previously, the VIASPACE agronomist visited several growing sites for our customer in the Philippines. These sites are suitable for Giant King Grass, and the customer is awaiting an import permit to be issued by the Philippine government.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;Korea and Japan represent markets for Giant King Grass in Asia. Although these countries are too cold to grow Giant King Grass themselves, they are actively importing both energy pellets and animal feed. Korea is particularly aggressive in seeking out supply contracts in the warmer climates of the Asia-Pacific region and Korean parties that have contacted VIASPACE are interested in investing in renewable biomass projects.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;VIASPACE is in discussions with companies from Australia, India and Pakistan. A power plant and pellet mill project developer from Pakistan recently traveled to California to visit and tour the VIASPACE Giant King Grass propagation nursery. The proposed project would provide electricity for Pakistan and pellets for export. These negotiations are ongoing and progressing nicely.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen concluded, &quot;The Asia Pacific region represents a major business opportunity for VIASPACE. Many parts of the region have the warm weather, sunshine and water needed to grow Giant King Grass and have a great need for electricity at a cost lower than they are currently paying for electricity generated from oil.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more developed countries such as Japan and Korea also need biomass for clean renewable energy and for animal feed and are inclined to purchase these products from their geographic neighbors in the region which helps to minimize direct shipping costs.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;We are making a major push to close additional deals in the Asia Pacific region and move our company forward on a global scale as rapidly as possible. This third CEO update highlights many of these opportunities and occurs as multiple negotiations are underway with clients and international financing entities. Our goal is to finish this year with a strong pipeline of new projects staged to produce significant future revenue starting in 2014.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

Animals need both protein and dry matter (fiber) and both types of animal feed are needed in the marketplace.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dairy cows and feedlot cattle are typically fed a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) of forage, grains, protein supplements, minerals and vitamins that are thoroughly mixed to meet the nutritional needs of the animal. If the forage has higher nutritional value, less supplements are required which lowers the cost of feeding the animals.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;The advantage of Giant King Grass is its very high yield, and the fact that it is perennial which means that replanting every year is not<br />required. The data shows that Giant King Grass nutritional value can be as good as alfalfa when cut short, and oat or sorghum hay when it is cut taller--but with twice the yield and you don&#39;t have to replant every year.<span>&nbsp; </span>This means lower cost of production and higher profits for the grower.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition to the announced animal feed project in Arizona, VIASPACE is pursuing multiple other animal feed opportunities.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented: &quot;The U.S. domestic and international animal feed markets are enormous, growing in demand and confirm an immediate and significant market and revenue source for VIASPACE and its shareholders. The current demand for animal feed represents a sales equivalent of U.S. $300 billion worldwide and is projected to double by 2050. VIASPACE and its business partners can initiate and implement Giant King Grass animal feed projects anywhere in the world with suitable climate and irrigation/rainfall very quickly with lower capital cost than our power plant projects. The first U.S. commercial plantings of Giant King grass for animal feed are currently underway with VIASPACE and SynTawa Energy in Arizona. We expect increased demand for Giant King Grass in low-frost areas of the U.S. Southeast, Southwest and Hawaii in addition to our documented global outreach.

One suggestion was to double check the results of our forage analysis. VIASPACE has previously utilized near infrared analysis (NIR) from the Dairy One Forage Laboratory in Ithaca, New York. UC Davis recommended a comparison of the NIR data with a full wet chemistry analysis, and also recommended a second laboratory, Cumberland Valley Analytical Services, which tested the same sample using both NIR and wet chemistry. Using both laboratories and both methods produced the same results and confirmed that Giant King Grass is an excellent animal feed.</span></p><p style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span style="font: 7pt/normal ''Times New Roman''; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Our VIASPACE partner in the Arizona animal feed project, Maricopa Bio Crops, came to California where we held technical and business meetings and met with a mechanical harvesting expert in the Central Valley.

These are authorized shares and none of these shares have been issued. We have been very judicious with issuing limited additional shares; however, the number of issued shares was getting close to the number of authorized shares. The Board plans to minimize dilution consistent with operating the company, but needs the flexibility of additional authorized shares for continued growth, financing and partnerships.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe continued, &quot;Since October of 2012, when I became Chairman of the Board, I have loaned VIASPACE a total of $342,000 in the form of Senior Convertible Loans. As per our five-year, one million dollar loan agreement, I am able to convert these loans into common shares which I have immediately done after making the loans. I have made the immediate conversion with two motivations in mind. First, by converting to common shares, I have intentionally minimized additional debt on VIASPACE&#39;s books. Secondly, I personally believe that our share price is undervalued by the market and that my conversions to common shares will make a handsome return on investment in the future. I know of no better way to show and convey my confidence in the future of the Company.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe concluded, &quot;I now hold 152,500,472 VIASPACE common shares and have become the company&#39;s second largest common shareholder. As Chairman of the Board, I think and act on behalf of all common shareholders. I believe that 2014 will be a pivotal year for VIASPACE in both the green energy market and the animal feed market. We are a budding global company with aspirations to greatness and a terrific pipeline of projects to propel us in that direction, several of which are very close to reaching fruition. I am pushing our company, CEO and Board of Directors to make 2014 our breakout year for generating revenues with the goal to grow revenues year by year from here forward.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean<br />electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

Magazine', '', '<span style="font-size: 11pt">January 15, 2014 - Walnut, California - <span style="color: black">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today<br />announced that the January 2014 issue of &quot;Hay and Forage Grower&quot; Magazine features a full page article entitled &quot;Energy Crop As A Livestock Feed&quot; which describes Giant King Grass being commercially established in Arizona by VIASPACE business partner, Maricopa Bio Crops, LLC of Scottsdale, Arizona.</span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The article starts by revealing that: &quot;In the Arizona desert, the first US commercial plantings of Giant King Grass are being established--for use as livestock feed first, and hopefully as a renewable energy feedstock in the future...The perennial hybrid... can grow to 20 feet, has a crude protein level of 14 - 15.6% and can be harvested five times per year. One cutting taken for bioenergy use can yield 22 - 24 tons dry matter/acre.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Previously it was announced that Giant King Grass was planted on land irrigated from the Colorado River in southern Arizona on October 1, 2013. This was the first step in the planned initial 4,500 acre Giant King Grass plantation to produce Giant King Grass hay for cattle feed in Arizona. Two additional 4,500 acre phases are also planned.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maricopa Bio Crops will grow and market the Giant King Grass under VIASPACE direction, and both companies will share the profits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Mr. Patrick Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Maricopa Bio Crops and Syn Tawa Energy, LLC which is building a bio refinery to convert cellulosic biomass into premium diesel fuel is quoted, &quot;The goal for planting Giant King Grass is twofold. It should prove that the crop can be grown in Arizona and sold as livestock feed as well as serve as refinery&#39;s backup feedstock. Its primary market will be local area beef and dairy cattle. Giant King Grass is higher quality protein and it is a good nutritional forage compared to what ranchers are using now. We are working on long-term contracts now with some of the largest cattle feedlots and dairies in the state.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Maricopa Project Manager Bob Buckingham reports, &quot;I have been working closely with VIASPACE on our commercial venture. I am focusing on both technical and business issues. We are planning to rapidly expand our propagation nursery into a commercial farm. We visited VIASPACE late last year for discussions of mechanical harvesting approaches. I brought back some more Giant King Grass and recently completed a germination test under ideal conditions and found that 100% of the single nodes germinated. This is outstanding. VIASPACE has conducted some experiments on planting for animal feed, and obtained additional data on the forage quality. We are using these results in our expansion planning.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have met with potential customers and they are eagerly awaiting Giant King Grass.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;VIASPACE and Maricopa are working well together,&quot; states VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen. &quot;This is a true partnership and we have also become friends. We are fully supporting the commercial expansion in Arizona and will continue to provide updates as they are available. We expect that the animal feed operation will be profitable for both our companies.&quot; VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, added: &quot;Our business partnership with Maricopa Bio Crops is progressing rapidly on multiple levels and the anticipated revenues from our profit sharing business structure should tangibly grow the value of our company.

(OTCQB: VSPC) issued the following update on the Giant King Grass project in Nicaragua.</span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE previously announced that it has entered into a contract with AGRICORP, the largest rice company in Nicaragua, and is growing Giant King Grass on land owned by them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Giant King Grass is growing well in&nbsp;Nicaragua, and VIASPACE and AGRICORP have agreed to form a partnership to build a 12 MW biomass power plant fueled by Giant King Grass.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">In addition to the 12 MW biomass power plant partnership, VIASPACE and AGRICORP have now decided to add animal feed as a second focus to the overall business project in Nicaragua.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, visited Nicaragua last week. He spent three days at the Giant King Grass growing site which is part of the Miramontes rice plantation on Lake Nicaragua. The 10,000 acre plantation has approximately 6,000 acres planted in rice and the remaining 4,000 acres are available for growing Giant King Grass. The 12 MW power plant will require a 2,100 acre Giant King Grass plantation. Irrigation is plentiful and is provided from Lake Nicaragua to supplement the natural rainfall.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Giant King Grass was originally planted in Nicaragua in December 2012. It was first harvested in May 2013, and another Giant King Grass field was planted using material propagated from this first harvest. Giant King Grass is not grown from seed, but rather from cuttings similar to the way sugarcane is propagated and planted.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The existing Giant King Grass is being harvested and an additional 29 acres are being planted. The multiplication efficiency of Giant King Grass is extremely high with 1 acre of Giant King Grass able to produce enough cuttings to plant more than 100 new acres every six months.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kukkonen reports, &quot;I was there for the harvest, propagation and planting. We are gathering valuable data on Giant King Grass yield, propagation efficiency, and the time and cost required for harvesting and planting.<span>&nbsp; </span>This data is important for the power plant financial model, and for the planning of the full-scale plantation, which must be ready four to six months before the power plant is completed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;The rice plantation operated by AGRICORP has more than 200 employees and a full range of equipment that we are able to leverage. Two of their top agronomists are working with us on the Giant King Grass plantation.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are pleased with the growth and propagation of Giant King Grass and we are using part of the new planting area for optimization of Giant King Grass cultivation in Nicaragua to maximize yield and reduce costs. Another portion of the new planting area is for producing animal feed which will be a second line of business of the Giant King Grass plantation. We will be harvesting Giant King Grass for animal feed within 90 days and will initially be feeding cattle on the plantation. We will be making green chop, silage and hay. There are 5 million people in Nicaragua and 6 million cattle which illustrates the demand for animal feed. Nicaraguan beef is famous in the region. An animal nutritionist has joined the team. He is designing the Total Mixed Ration (TMR) for the cattle. Because of its high nutritional value, the Giant King Grass not only provides fiber required by the cattle, it can replace a substantial amount of expensive nutritional supplements in the ration which results in a substantially lower overall cost.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;This is an important business step for our partnership with AGRICORP in Nicaragua for several reasons. First, we are creating a combined business model of using Giant King Grass for animal feed in conjunction or parallel with the development of a plantation to fuel a 12 MW biomass power plant. In other words, this business model will generate animal feed revenues in the short term while simultaneously providing Giant King Grass propagation material to establish a biomass plantation that will in turn generate biomass driven electricity revenues in the longer term.

(1423, 'First Production Scale Test of Giant King Grass Grinding Equipment for Nicaragua Power Plant', '', '<span style="font-size: 11pt">February 24, 2014 - Walnut, California - <span style="color: black">VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) conducted a full production scale test of Giant King Grass grinding equipment on February 18, 2014 in Portland, Oregon. 6,000 pounds of 18 foot tall Giant King Grass stalks were cut and shredded in a few minutes in a test of a candidate grinder for the 12 MW Giant King Grass power plant being developed in Nicaragua.&nbsp;</span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Pictures and videos from the from the test grind are available on the VIASPACE Facebook page </span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc" title="blocked::http://www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc"><span style="font-size: 11pt">www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt">or can be accessed directly at <a href="http://vimeo.com/87430477" title="blocked::http://vimeo.com/87430477">http://vimeo.com/87430477</a>.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The grinding test was conducted on a large, stationary, horizontal grinder manufactured by West Salem Machinery Company of Salem, Oregon that was installed at the Greenway Recycling Facility in Portland, Oregon. Three tons of Giant King Grass were harvested from the VIASPACE propagation nursery in California and were then transported to Portland for the test.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen reported, &quot;When Giant King Grass is ready for harvest, each plant has 15 to 25 stalks, and each stalk is 16 to 20 feet tall. The Giant King Grass must be cut into smaller pieces in order to be used in a power plant or biofuels facility. This size reduction and shredding can be done as part of harvest with a forage harvester, or whole stalks can be harvested and transported to a central processing facility adjacent to the power plant where an electrically powered processing system can be utilized (as opposed to using diesel powered machines in the field). The latter approach is being used in Nicaragua.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;An electrically powered grinder is lower cost and has lower maintenance than a diesel powered grinder. We plan to install the grinder in our fuel processing and short-term storage facility just outside the power plant. Since it is a stationary and large machine, the only way to test it was to bring the Giant King Grass to the grinder.<span>&nbsp; </span>That is what we did. Our production needs are 36 tons per hour, 24 hours per day, and 365 days per year.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;I met with the West Salem Machinery team and visited their facilities where they manufacture their mill duty equipment. I want to thank Greenway Recycling for interrupting their business and allowing us to use their equipment for the Giant King Grass grinding test.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">West Salem Machinery CEO, Mark Lyman stated, &quot;Our company is family owned and has been in business since 1947. We make heavy duty, industrial strength, stationary grinders for the biomass, wood processing and recycling industries.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have installations at biomass power plants and biofuels facilities in the US and overseas. While we knew early on that our machine installed at Greenway Recycling was not ideally configured to process Giant King Grass, we were able to determine from this test that a customized version of our Titan-Series Horizontal Grinder would be capable of processing up to 40 tons per hour of raw stalks to a 50-100 mm sized fuel product suitable for the VIASPACE Giant King Grass power plant application. The full scale test was very important, because now we know exactly what Giant King Grass is and how to optimize our machine and the material flow for this application.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;It takes energy to make energy and in this case we are using the sun and agriculture to efficiently produce Giant King Grass and then converting that product (or stored energy) to usable electricity that is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We now have proof of concept that we can use an electrically powered grinder to prepare Giant King Grass for direct combustion in our Nicaragua power plant at a lower cost, lower maintenance and lower carbon emissions than using diesel powered grinding. Our overall corporate objective is not only to show our customers and partners how to use Giant King Grass as the most productive biomass platform in the world but also to demonstrate the very best method to efficiently convert Giant King Grass to electricity using the most profitable and reliable business model. Then we have a duplicative business model of &lsquo;growing your own electricity&#39; that can be replicated anywhere in the world with land, water and a suitable climate for growing Giant King Grass.

(OTCQB: VSPC) provided an update on the 7 MW Giant King Grass fueled anaerobic digestion power plant being developed by Tibbar Energy USVI, LLC on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.</span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tibbar Energy presented their 7MW Biogas Project at a CZM (Coastal Zone Management) Public Hearing on February 27<sup>th </sup>requesting a CZM permit. The presentation was made by CEO Ms. Tania Tomyn who reported, &quot;The public support was overwhelming from local residents and businesses.&nbsp; The island of St. Croix is about to see the first project of its kind with Tibbar&#39;s anaerobic digestion facility. We will produce lower cost, clean renewable power, create jobs, and develop a local organic fertilizer source that will be offered to local farmers.<span>&nbsp; </span>We will develop a 1,600 acre energy crop farming operation on the island using mainly Giant King Grass and some native local grasses, and we will use a treated effluent stream from Virgin Islands Waste Management Authority that is currently secondarily treated and discharged to the ocean for irrigation on half of our farms.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tomyn continued, &quot;Tibbar will also donate 1,000 round bales of hay to the Department of Agriculture for small farmer&#39;s livestock. Giant King Grass has grown extremely well on the island&nbsp; of St. Croix since we planted the first nursery 19 months ago.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The CZM Committee has 30 days to approve Tibbar&#39;s permit application. Tibbar has all other permits, including Air, Earth Change, Pipelines, and Electrical duct, submitted, deemed complete and working through the process.&nbsp; Last July 2013, Tibbar executed with WAPA (the local Government owned utility) a 25 year Power Purchase Agreement with 5 year option for $0.245/kwh and at the same time executed an interconnection agreement. The entire project is carbon neutral and will be the first fossil fuel independent base load power project on St. Croix.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">&quot;In addition to Tibbar&#39;s power production, we have added to our design a process that will allow Tibbar to produce hundreds of tons of quality organic fertilizer a year,&quot; Ms. Tomyn said. &quot;After our crops receive what they need and we have given all the fertilizer we can away to small farmers on the island of St. Croix, we will have an excess that we will export. It&#39;s a win-win with a perfect harmony of environmental and economic benefits&quot;.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen stated, &quot;We congratulate Tibbar on their progress, and we fully support their activities. Last year, Professor Mary Nikola from the Rutgers University School of Environmental and Biological Sciences contacted me about a potential field trip for her class to visit the renewable energy project in St. Croix. Tibbar agreed and the class visited in January.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, also commented, &quot;We are very excited about Tibbar&#39;s continuing progress and show of public and local government support on St. Croix to create base load, 24/7 electricity using Giant King Grass as a continuously renewable biomass platform for anaerobic digestion power production. The byproduct of quality organic fertilizer makes this process an even larger environmental leap ahead of fossil fuel power generation. It is only a matter of time that more tropical islands and island nations (Caribbean and South Pacific) realize the environmental and economic benefits of using Giant King Grass as their continuously renewable, green energy, biomass platform.

(OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that the St. Croix government has approved Tibbar Energy&#39;s permit to build a 7-megawatt biogas power plant on the island of St. Croix. The government approved the permit on Tuesday evening, March 25, 2014 during a meeting at&nbsp;the Virgin Islands Port Authority.</span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The final&nbsp;approval came from the Virgin Island Department on Planning and<br />Natural Resources&#39; Division of Coastal Zone Management (CMZ). The CMZ decision was the last step that Tibbar Energy needed in order to begin construction on its 7-megawatt biogas power plant which will supply electricity created from VIASPACE Giant King Grass to the Virgin Island Water and Power Authority (WAPA) for at least the next 25 years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tania Tomyn, Tibbar Energy CEO, stated, &quot;Tibbar is thrilled about building its<br />renewable energy plant on St. Croix. We will provide 7 megawatts of base load power for WAPA for the next 25 years from&nbsp;Giant King Grass&nbsp;grown on the island. Tibbar is required to begin producing power by December 2015 pursuant to the power purchase agreement. WAPA has no other base load renewable power source and Tibbar&#39;s project will allow WAPA to be compliant under the Renewable Portfolio Standard. Tibbar&#39;s general contractor&nbsp;will begin site&nbsp;work as early as May or June and the expected schedule is 18 months for both the farming operations and the biogas plant. The project should create more than 150 jobs during construction and 35 permanent jobs.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Mary Eckard, President of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce, was quoted, &quot;The St. Croix Chamber of Commerce is elated to hear of the creation of 150 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs on the island&nbsp;of St. Croix at a time<br />when our economy sorely needs jobs. We are also very excited and supportive of anything that can meaningfully and immediately reduce our cost of energy on the island of St. Croix.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tomyn concluded, &quot;I am proud to be a resident of St. Croix and take part in developing a green energy source that will reduce power costs, create jobs and is independent&nbsp;from&nbsp;fossil fuels.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Tibbar is also providing 1,000 bales of hay for the Virgin Island Department of Agriculture for small farmer&#39;s livestock throughout the territory. In addition to the electricity power production, the power plant design process will produce<br />hundreds of tons of quality organic fertilizer per year. Tibbar has agreed to provide this organic fertilizer to the Department of Agriculture and to local farmers at no cost. Last July 2013, Tibbar executed with WAPA a 25 year Power Purchase Agreement with a 5 year extension option for $0.245/kwh and at the same time executed an interconnection agreement. The entire project is carbon neutral and represents the Caribbean&#39;s first continuously renewable, green energy, biomass power plant.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;We have come a long way in a relatively short time frame&nbsp;with Tibbar Energy&nbsp;to use VIASPACE&nbsp;Giant King Grass as a dedicated, renewable, green energy crop for biogas electricity production on St. Croix. We are proud of this partnership and extend our warmest congratulations to Tibbar for achieving the final CMZ approval to start construction of their 7-megawatt biomass power plant. We are excited to show the world how well this renewable&nbsp;green energy power plant works to create base load, 24/7 electricity using Giant King Grass while simultaneously creating local jobs and organic fertilizer. We have the 24/7 alternative energy solution for any tropical island nation desiring carbon neutral freedom from more expensive imported&nbsp;fossil fuels. VIASPACE and Giant King Grass can make a giant difference for a greener world and we intend to accomplish that objective with economic benefits to our partners and shareholders.&quot;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">About VIASPACE Inc.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

Giant King Grass has been growing well there since 2012. Rice husks from the Miramontes rice mill will be a secondary fuel providing about 5% of the overall fuel requirement.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The project will generate 84,000,000 kWh of saleable electricity which will be transmitted on the national grid and sold both to the grid and to private customers. The project lifetime is 25 years. Meetings have been held with both debt and equity financiers. It is expected that 70% of the project cost will be covered by debt and 30% by equity. The prefeasibility study has been completed and the formal feasibility study process is underway.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen reports, &quot;The International Biomass Conference was very valuable. Many US and global biomass and green energy companies attended, and we were able to schedule meetings that otherwise would have required extensive travel. My presentation was very well received and several parties are interested in replicating our Nicaragua project in their countries. I met with potential partners and customers from the US, Europe, Mexico, Central and South America as well as Asia.<span>&nbsp; </span>I expect that new business will develop from this conference.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Kukkonen continued, &quot;The Nicaragua project is our flagship. VIASPACE is playing the role of project co-developer as well as supplier of Giant King Grass. Many potential customers are following this project closely. VIASPACE&#39;s strategic goal is to assemble an engineering, construction and financing team that we can work with on this project and many others in the future.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Kevin Schewe, VIASPACE Board Chairman, commented, &quot;The International Biomass Conference and Expo is the largest biomass conference in North America. The technical sessions contain the most comprehensive biomass presentations gathered from around the world. We are pleased that Dr. Kukkonen was invited to speak at the International Colloquium Bonus Session and give an update on our 2,100 acre Giant King Grass plantation and co-located 12MW power plant in Nicaragua. We used this forum to first announce &quot;Energia Reino Verde&quot; (&quot;Green Kingdom Energy&quot;), our new joint company formed to generate 84,000,000 kWh of saleable electricity to the Nicaraguan power grid and to private customers. As co-developer, VIASPACE both supplies Giant King Grass and is a partner in the sale of electricity. Another beauty of this project is our role to assemble an essential and efficient business development framework that can be replicated in the region and globally.

(OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that Mesquite Lake Water and Power LLC has planted a 22 acre nursery of Giant King Grass in the Imperial Valley of Southern California.<span>&nbsp; </span>More than 2,200 acres of Giant King Grass can be produced from this nursery as early as September 2014.</span></span><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Previously VIASPACE reported that it had signed a contract with Mesquite Lake Water and Power to provide Giant King Grass for an 18 MW biomass power plant and a companion advanced biofuels facility which are a part of the Mesquite Lake Energy Park that is being developed in Imperial, California.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Mr. Rodney L. Williams, managing member of Mesquite Lake, stated, &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are moving quickly to establish the Giant King Grass as a viable energy crop to be grown in the Imperial Valley. Our goal is to be prepared with fuel on hand when the power plant reopens. VIASPACE is working closely with our team. Within two weeks of signing the contract, we had Giant King Grass planted in the Valley. We are experiencing plant germination and emergence daily! This is the initial step involved in the creation of developing large tracts of land in the Imperial Valley for commercial production<span style="color: black">.&quot;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, stated, &quot;Giant King Grass is grown from cuttings not from seeds which is the same way that sugarcane is propagated. We harvested Giant King Grass at the dedicated VIASPACE nursery in Southern California and prepared 5 tons of propagation material which were picked up by Mesquite Lake and taken to the Imperial Valley and planted. Mesquite Lake is an important project for the Imperial Valley and for VIASPACE and we are fully supporting it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">The 22 acre Giant King Grass propagation nursery is in the center area of a one square mile (640 acre) section that currently has wheat planted on it. The soil was tilled and manure was incorporated to provide fertilizer. After smoothing, a GPS guided tractor created the furrows for planting the Giant King Grass. The Imperial&nbsp; Valley is hot and dry, but has abundant irrigation water. A sprinkler system was installed to provide irrigation for germination and steady growth. The Giant King Grass was manually planted. This process was quite efficient, but mechanical planting will also be available.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">VIASPACE Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, further explained, &quot;For a typical new customer, we usually start with a 5 acre Giant King Grass propagation nursery which serves to prove that Giant King Grass grows well in that specific locale and provides adequate Giant King Grass seedlings/nodes to propagate a plantation corresponding to the client&#39;s timetable. Our project with Mesquite Lake Water and Power is very different and exciting for our company and its shareholders. We know that Giant King Grass will thrive in Imperial Valley because it is right next door to our Southern California dedicated VIASPACE corporate nursery. In Imperial Valley, we shipped 5 tons of seedlings and planted 22 acres as the starting point. I strongly encourage all interested parties and investors to examine the pictures that we have posted on our VIASPACE Facebook page showing the Imperial&nbsp; Valley planting and irrigation. Our partner is experienced in agriculture and has access to adequate land. We planted 22 acres because it can be rapidly propagated to 2,200 acres this year. Our partner plans to restart their 18MW power plant (Mesquite Lake Energy Park Plant #1) and fuel it with a combination of wood waste and Giant King Grass. They also plan to convert ML Energy Park Plant #2 to produce advanced biofuels using Giant King Grass as the dedicated feed stock.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt">Dr. Schewe concluded, &quot;Dr. Kukkonen recently traveled to Denver, Colorado and we jointly met with potential project financing sources and we were very well received. Our general business plan for revenues based on our Giant King Grass license fees, the combination of license fees plus the sale of electricity and partnering for advanced biofuels, pellet production and animal feed projects was likened to establishing a large pipeline of 25-year corporate annuities. We are now seeing increased financial interest in continuously renewable, biomass-based, green energy production. Dr. Kukkonen left Denver&nbsp;and then traveled to another continent to supervise the planting of Giant King Grass for another new client which we will soon announce. Our shareholders and investors want to see significant revenue and we are very actively building that revenue pipeline.

The current global market volume of demand for biomass pellets is about 16 million metric tons annually and is projected to essentially triple to 46 million tons annually by 2020, representing a total market value of $8 billion U.S. Most of the near-term growth is predicted in wood fuel pellet markets worldwide. At VIASPACE, we know that we have a better solution to this demand. Our product, Giant King Grass, is rapidly and continuously renewable (can be harvested at 15 feet height twice per year in a rain forest climate like Guyana) as opposed to trees which provide a vital environmental canopy and have a long life cycle.&rdquo;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Schewe concluded, &ldquo;I am truly excited for our Company and its shareholders to add Guyana and South America to our global footprint!

The conference covered fossil fuel and renewable electricity projects in the region, and the Nicaragua Energ&iacute;a Reino Verde project was presented as a case study.<span>&nbsp; </span>Kukkonen&rsquo;s presentation, titled &ldquo;12 MW Biomass Power Plant with 840 Hectare Energy Crop Plantation&rdquo;, described the power plant project in Nicaragua and other applications of Giant King Grass in the Central American region.</span></font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Kukkonen reported, &ldquo;The Platts Conference in Panama was attended by over 300 delegates and provided a good overview of electricity production in Central America. Expensive bunker oil provides most of the electricity in the region. The most important goals in the Central American countries are to reduce electricity costs and to provide additional, reliable generation capability. Other goals include reduced carbon emissions, and renewable energy. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported from the US or the Middle East was viewed as an attractive large-scale future option and LNG projects are in development in Guatemala and Panama. Liquid petroleum gas (propane) was also discussed. Liquefied natural gas requires significant infrastructure development and the resulting price is only slightly below bunker oil, but carbon emissions are lower.&rdquo;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Kukkonen continued, &ldquo;There were three presentations on renewable energy: one on wind, one on solar and my presentation on biomass energy. A very good aspect about this conference is that there were not parallel sessions and all of the delegates heard all of the talks. In my presentation, I pointed out that Giant King Grass electricity is 30% cheaper than electricity from bunker oil and has zero carbon emissions. I described the Nicaragua project and emphasized that biomass energy provides reliable, 24/7 green electricity in contrast with wind and solar that are intermittent and require additional, reliable and quick reacting backup electricity generating sources. On average, solar photovoltaic electricity is only available 25% of the time-- during daylight and sunny hours-- and requires a bunker oil generator the rest of the time. Wind electricity production is proportional to windspeed and this is quite variable. In a constant power application, wind, on average, only provides 34% of the power and the rest must be provided by bunker oil.<span>&nbsp; </span>Including the backup power, Giant King Grass electricity is considerably less expensive than solar or wind.<span>&nbsp; </span>I received many questions after my presentation and expressions of interest from investors and potential projects in other countries.&rdquo;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &ldquo;The Platts Private Power in Central America Conference is a prestigious, annual regional event that attracts key business, financial and government representatives interested in developing additional electricity production for Central America where there is a true need for expansion. Dr. Kukkonen gave the only presentation on renewable, biomass electricity generation and his talk effectively highlighted our planned 12 Megawatt Energia Reino Verde power plant project in Nicaragua and emphasized using Giant King Grass as the dependable, well-characterized feedstock to create that electricity. As opposed to wind and solar power, our Giant King Grass continuously renewable biomass solution provides green energy electricity 24/7, and like wind and solar power, it reduces dependence on fossil fuels and is carbon neutral. As we have recently reported, VIASPACE is continuing to make excellent progress for renewable, green energy development in Central America and the Caribbean and we are in the process of increasing our footprint in that region.&rdquo;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">About VIASPACE Inc.</font></span></strong></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>TM </sup>Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

We applaud and congratulate Selectra and Harmony for their successful demonstration. We first delivered Giant King Grass to Selectra in January 2013 and it was planted on Harmony land. We were very apprehensive about the project because the worst mine affected lands called slimes dams were so poor in quality, we didn&rsquo;t even know if Giant King Grass would grow. Selectra and Harmony have proven that Giant King Grass can grow well. The Giant King Grass mitigates erosion and contaminated dust from the slimes dams, and Selectra has shown that it is a good feedstock for anaerobic digestion to produce biogas.

(1439, 'VIASPACE CEO Interview with The Wall Street Transcript', '', 'August 25, 2014 - Walnut, California - VIASPACE Inc. (OTCQB: VSPC) today announced that CEO Dr. Carl Kukkonen was interviewed by The Wall Street Transcript, a paid subscription publication and website that publishes biweekly industry reports that feature equity analyst, money manager and CEO interviews. In publication since 1963, The Wall Street Transcript has interviewed the CEOs and senior executives of public companies and publishes these interviews verbatim. The full interview is available to paid subscribers only, and is available at http://www.twst.com/interview/30350 .<p>Below is an excerpt from the interview of Dr. Kukkonen.</p><p>&quot;VIASPACE focuses on the renewable biomass energy business and on our Giant King Grass, which is a proprietary biomass crop. Biomass is just a fancy word for biological materials such as trees, grass and crops. And so when people are talking about biofuels or bio energy or biomass, they are talking about fuels that are derived from trees, grass, or crops. In the renewable energy business, the most well known things are wind energy, solar energy, and hydroelectricity. And the attractive things about these options is that the energy source is free. The sun is free and wind is free and there are also no carbon dioxide emissions, but the major disadvantages of these solar and wind are that they are intermittent. Wind energy is only there when the wind blows and you can&#39;t depend on it for electricity. You need a backup generator to go with the wind power plant so that when the wind isn&#39;t blowing the generator is going and the wind is blowing hard, the generator generates less, but you really need two power plants if you are going to use wind. Similarly for solar, what are you going to do in the night time or on a cloudy day, you need a backup and batteries are good for your laptop or your cell phone but the batteries aren&#39;t available on a utility scale. So for solar and wind you need backup power, which means two power plants and that makes it more expensive. </p><p>Biomass electricity is pretty simple; you grow biomass-- wood or grass-- and you dry it, and you burn it in a power plant instead of coal or oil. And since biomass can be stored, it can be burned continuously to give you reliable 24/7 electricity and that&#39;s the major advantage compared to solar and wind. It&#39;s not intermittent. It can be used as base electricity and it can be sent whenever and wherever you want. Biomass electricity is renewable because you can grow the crop every year and it&#39;s also carbon neutral. When you burn biomass it puts carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but biomass breathes carbon dioxide just like people breathe oxygen, and that carbon dioxide is sucked back out of the atmosphere, and overall biomass electricity is carbon neutral. The key with biomass electricity or biofuels or biomaterials is where do you get the biomass for the product. You need a reliable and affordable source of the biomass and that&#39;s what VIASPACE offers. Our Giant King Grass is the highest yielding crop in the world and it&#39;s grown specifically for energy. It can be grown on marginal land where it doesn&#39;t compete with crops. Because its high yield, it needs minimal land, and it is the lowest cost biomass. Giant King Grass is a perennial crop and it actually improves the soil quality where it&#39;s grown. However, it is a tropical crop and doesn&#39;t survive a freezing weather and that gets into your question of where we are working on this. Giant King Grass is suitable for California, for Arizona, and the Southern US. We&#39;re also growing in Hawaii, in the US Virgin Islands on Saint Croix, but then you start looking south and we have projects in Nicaragua, Jamaica, and Guyana in South America. You look at other tropical regions in Africa, we are growing in South Africa and looking at other opportunities in tropical Africa, and we&#39;re also growing in Myanmar in Southeast Asia and in China and there are opportunities in Thailand, Philippines etc. So our business focus is in these warmer areas.</p><p>I can give you an example (of how we do business). We are developing a 12 megawatt Giant King Grass power plant in Nicaragua and the way we work is this. We don&#39;t know how to do business in Nicaragua but we find a local partner, and our partner in Nicaragua is a company called Agricorp, which is one of the largest companies in the country. They are an agro business company and they grow rice amongst other things. So they have a 6,000 acre rice plantation in Nicaragua already. They are experienced in doing this. They have the land, they have the irrigation. They have 4,000 extra acres that are not suitable for rice and we have decided to grow Giant King Grass on that land and to build a 12 megawatt biomass power plant. That&#39;s an example of how we do business. In Nicaragua and in many of these other countries, especially island nations, the basic electricity generation comes from oil. They burn oil and that turns a generator and makes electricity. Oil is extraordinarily expensive and biomass electricity with Giant King Grass is about 30% cheaper than oil and it&#39;s clean and carbon neutral, and it&#39;s renewable. There are lots of advantages for Nicaragua where they have a lot of agriculture but also have a lot of farmers out of work. So growing Giant King Grass provides jobs for their farmers. The power plant is going to provide good jobs as well. We are going to be introducing sustainable agriculture to Nicaragua and the money stays in Nicaragua rather than going overseas to pay for oil. So it&#39;s a win in many of these countries and that&#39;s how we do business. We focus in regions where there is a need for electricity and current electricity is expensive. In developing countries, it is much easier to introduce a new technology-actually biomass electricity is actually a very old technology because people were burning wood hundreds of years ago- but bringing this in as a commercial scale to produce electricity is now very attractive in these countries that are just emerging from the third world into the second world status.</p><p>The 12 MW Giant King Grass power plant in Nicaragua will be our flagship. We&#39;ve built up a large pipeline of potential projects that are all watching the Nicaragua project, and what we expect will happen is that Nicaragua will be our showroom. We expect that we will be doing probably three or four projects per year. At this stage, the environment is pretty good and probably the equity financing is the most challenging part of it, but the countries are very excited about biomass energy that they can grow themselves. The international development banks find this a very attractive opportunity for development in these countries and are willing to do the debt financing and just finding the equity financiers that are willing to do countries like Guyana and Nicaragua is probably the challenge at the moment.</p><p>We understand the positives and the negatives of biomass energy and we feel that we know the niche very well, and we can deliver a solution to a customer. We have the full financial models and all of the technical information needed so that if a potential partner in Indonesia or some other company or country comes to us, we can quickly evaluate that opportunity and we can use all of the expertise we developed so far to put together a plan to move forward very quickly.&quot;</p><p>About VIASPACE Inc.<br />VIASPACE grows renewable Giant KingTM Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials.

The plan is to then let the water run downhill and produce hydroelectricity when the wind is not blowing or during the nighttime. This is certainly possible, but growing Giant King Grass to fuel a reliable and 24/7 biomass power plant is a simpler and lower cost solution. Pumping water uphill to a dam is the only way to store electricity today on a large scale. It may be feasible in very special areas, but Giant King Grass clean renewable electricity should have much broader applicability. There was also a detailed concept to bring in containers of liquefied natural gas to the big island of Hawaii to replace oil for producing reliable electricity. This is feasible and would be a bit less expensive than oil and natural gas produces less carbon dioxide than oil. Both of these examples illustrate how difficult and expensive it is to produce electricity on island nations.&rdquo;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&ldquo;I met with parties that are trying to develop biomass power plants using anaerobic digestion to produce clean bio electricity.

Giant King Grass is also&nbsp;now being grown and tested in a research collaboration with the University of California   Agriculture and Natural Resources Division (UCANR).&nbsp;Giant King Grass behaves like other forage crops in that younger shorter cuttings&nbsp;are more tender with higher protein and lower fiber whereas slightly older cuttings produce more dry matter lower in protein but higher in fiber. Animals need both protein and fiber and both types of animal feed are needed in the marketplace. The data shows that Giant King Grass has&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp;value nearly as good as alfalfa when cut short and better than oat or sorghum hay when it is cut taller. Giant King Grass can be harvested 4-5 times&nbsp;per year for animal&nbsp;feed, has extremely high yield and is perennial (does not have to be replanted each year). This means lower cost of production and higher profits for the&nbsp;grower.&nbsp;The current demand for animal feed represents a sales equivalent of U.S. $300 billion worldwide and is expected to steadily double between now and 2050. VIASPACE has significant animal feed projects which should begin to&nbsp;come to fruition&nbsp;in 2015 in&nbsp;Nicaragua and Pakistan. </font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Our flagship bioenergy project is the 12MW Giant King Grass fueled power plant in Nicaragua to be co-located with a 2,100 acre Giant King Grass plantation adjacent to the Miramontes rice plantation located on and irrigated from Lake  Nicaragua.

(OTC: VSPC) today reported that its customer, Tibbar Energy USVI, states that:<br />&middot;	Required permits will be in place by February 2015.<br />&middot;	Giant KingTM Grass from its nurseries on St. Croix is ready for the production fields.<br />&middot;	Construction is scheduled to begin in second quarter of 2015.<p>The 7-megawatt anaerobic digestion biogas power plant will provide the only base load renewable electricity in the USVI. The majority feedstock is VIASPACE Giant King Grass. Tibbar will sell power for 25 years with an additional 5 year option to USVI Water and Power Authority (WAPA).</p><p>Tania Tomyn, Tibbar Energy CEO, stated, &quot;We will have all of our pre-development permits in place. It&#39;s been a long and busy three years of hard work developing the farms, the engineering for the biogas plant and working with so many great suppliers and advisers around the world, and the different agencies of the US Virgin Islands government--we would not be here without them.  Now the fun part starts when we actualize and begin construction. The Giant King Grass nurseries are ready to be transplanted to the new farms once cleared and irrigation is installed. The project should start construction second quarter of 2015. Our agriculture team likes the results from the Giant King Grass that has been growing on the island for over two years now and they see how well it fits in the US Virgin Islands as a tropical perennial grass for energy production.&quot;    </p><p>Tomyn continued, &quot;Our project is a balance of agriculture and power production and is all carbon neutral. The Tibbar project is a very significant job creator and clean energy production project that will tremendously benefit the people of the US Virgin Islands.  In addition, we will also be a major water reclamation project for the USVI.  Our agricultural irrigation comes from a secondarily treated effluent that is currently being discharged to the ocean.  Now this water can be reused for non-food crops, as the EPA recommends. We recover water that would be lost, reduce power bills by 4 to 5% to the Virgin Islander ratepayers and create a lot of jobs.  This is where energy sector should be.&quot; </p><p>VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &quot;VIASPACE and our partner, Tibbar Energy, have mutually shared a vision to construct and implement the Caribbean&#39;s first carbon neutral, base load, green/renewable electric power plant on the island of St. Croix. We have been pursuing this vision at a time of unprecedented global warming, with 2014 being documented as the warmest year of global record keeping. Using continuously renewable and high-yielding Giant King Grass to create electricity through an anaerobic digestion biogas power plant is a green energy answer and solution to realistically reducing continued high carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Schewe concluded, &quot;We are proud of the progress that Tibbar Energy has made on St. Croix. We believe that the successful implementation of this project will be widely recognized as establishing green, renewable energy leadership in the Caribbean region and will open many new doors for similar projects. We hope that it will create a &quot;Caribbean green energy tsunami&quot; that sweeps the region over the next decade and establishes global leadership for renewable, carbon-neutral, green energy projects in tropical and subtropical destinations.&quot;</p><p>About VIASPACE Inc.<br />VIASPACE grows renewable Giant KingTM Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials. Giant King Grass is a proprietary, high yield, dedicated biomass energy crop. Giant King Grass when it is cut frequently at 4 to 5 feet tall is also excellent animal feed. The USDA granted approval for planting Giant King Grass throughout the US and cooperates in exporting by performing the required inspections and issuing the phytosanitary certificate needed for import into foreign countries. Giant King Grass is being grown in California, Hawaii, St. Croix Virgin Islands, Nicaragua, South Africa, China, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines and Guyana.

Oil prices recently and rapidly fell by 50%. Some countries using oil-generated electricity are keeping the retail price of electricity high and making a large profit to pay off their debts. Speakers were unwilling to predict the future price of oil because the recent fall in oil prices took everyone by surprise, and no one would have predicted this large decline.</font><span><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span><font size="3">It was reported that the World Bank was suggesting that countries plan on oil at $65 per barrel. Liquefied natural gas projects are most impacted by the low price of oil. Although the price of natural gas in the </font><font size="3">US</font><font size="3"> is quite low, the cost of liquefying it and transporting it makes it more expensive than oil today when delivered to the </font><font size="3">Caribbean</font><font size="3">.

We emphasized that Giant King Grass generated electricity is carbon neutral, relatively inexpensive compared to other modalities, available as base load power 24/7, creates local farming and power plant jobs, keeps money in the local economy as opposed to exporting money for oil and is not subject to the known volatility of oil prices.

Electricity producers recognize that oil is not likely to stay at a low price for the 25 year life of a power plant, but they are profiting from the low oil prices while they last.

Our Nicaraguan partners have excellent working relationships with the government in </font><font size="3">Nicaragua</font><font size="3">.&quot;</font></font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&quot;One of our corporate&nbsp;strategies to address the economic challenges of this business space&nbsp;is to couple animal feed business activities with biomass and bioelectricity business. In other words,&nbsp;we can create cash flow using GKG&nbsp;animal feed while establishing a GKG&nbsp;plantation for biomass/bioelectricity purposes. We are working with our Nicaraguan partners to advance this concept and believe that our overall project in Nicaragua</font><font size="3"> will be an attractive global business model that can be replicated anywhere that GKG can be successfully cultivated. We are partnered with Almaden Energy Group (AEG) and we&nbsp;are growing GKG for animal feed in </font><font size="3">California</font><font size="3">&#39;s Central Valley and </font><font size="3">Imperial Valley</font><font size="3">.

Topics included specific feedstocks and applications, and also supply chain management for reliable delivery of the feedstocks to the conversion customers.</font></span></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dr. Kukkonen&rsquo;s presentation was entitled: &ldquo;Giant King Grass &ndash; Versatile Biomass for Bioenergy and Biorefineries&rdquo; and was the leadoff presentation in the session dedicated to Energy Crops. The presentation covered Giant King Grass characteristics and applications for biopower/bioelectricity through direct combustion and anaerobic digestion, and for biofuels and biochemicals using its cellulosic sugars. Laboratory analysis data was presented for these applications and also for using Giant King Grass as a feedstock for bio coal, energy pellets and as a high nutrition animal feed for dairy cows and cattle.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dr. Kukkonen stated, &ldquo;It is rare to find a single crop that can cover as many applications as Giant King Grass. If you cut it at 6-7 feet tall every two months, it is excellent animal feed. If you wait another month and cut it at 10 feet tall, it produces large amounts of biogas through anaerobic digestion. If you wait six months and it is 15 feet tall, it is the right time for cutting Giant King Grass for direct combustion in a power plant, energy pellets and as a feedstock for biofuels and biochemicals.&rdquo;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Dr. Kukkonen remarked that he found the conference to be very valuable and made many new business contacts.<span>&nbsp; </span></font><font size="3">&ldquo;I learned about a lot of other feedstocks, and each one may have its own niche, but none of them came close to the biomass yields of Giant King Grass.</font><span><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span><font size="3">This high yield characteristic makes Giant King Grass the lowest cost feedstock for any of the applications.&rdquo;</font></font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="color: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, &ldquo;VIASPACE has established itself as a leading authority in the business universe of renewable energy crops.

Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass is a proprietary, high yield, dedicated biomass energy crop. Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass when it is cut frequently at 4 to 5 feet tall is also excellent animal feed. The USDA granted approval for planting Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass throughout the US and cooperates in exporting by performing the required inspections and issuing the phytosanitary certificate needed for import into foreign countries. Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass is being grown in California, Hawaii, St. Croix Virgin Islands, Nicaragua, South Africa, China, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines and Guyana.&nbsp; For more information, please go to <a href="../">www.VIASPACE.com</a> or contact Dr. Jan Vandersande, Director of Communications, at 800-517-8050 or <a href="mailto:IR@VIASPACE.com.">IR@VIASPACE.com.</a></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Safe Harbor Statement</strong></p>  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: ''Times New Roman''">Information in this news release includes forward-looking statements.

(OTC: VSPC) announced that Clean Energy Solutions (CES) has retained VIASPACE as its agriculture feedstock resource and engineering expert for renewable energy projects being pursued in Hawaii.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">Clean Energy Solutions, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, develops renewable, clean energy projects including biogas and electricity. CES has extensive experience in project development and management, engineering and construction of power plants.</p><p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">In Hawaii, CES is working with Hawaii Gas, the state&rsquo;s only franchised gas utility, to assess the use of the VIASPACE Giant King Grass<sup><span style="font-size: 13pt">&reg;</span></sup> to produce biogas. Giant King Grass grows especially well in Hawaii and can produce some of the highest yields per acre of any energy crop. Perennial grasses like Giant King Grass also demonstrate favorable greenhouse gas system emissions, which reduces the net amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p><p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">Biogas produced from Giant King Grass can be upgraded to pipeline quality methane, which is known as renewable natural gas (RNG). RNG can then be used directly by gas utility customers, by the electric utility or independent power producers for electricity generation and by the transportation industry for fleet or passenger vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">Hawaii Gas is an indirect subsidiary of Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation, a $6.8 billion New York Stock Exchange listed corporation that owns, operates and invests in a portfolio of infrastructure businesses in the United States. Hawaii Gas supplies the island of Oahu with synthetic natural gas, and also provides propane to customers on the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Hawaii.</p><p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">VIASPACE Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, stated, &ldquo;There are 17,000 anaerobic digesters operating in Europe alone. We are well acquainted with biogas in Europe. This is a mature and reliable technology, with many potential suppliers of all components. The high yield of Giant King Grass makes it the most cost-effective energy crop to provide a secure source of feedstock for the digester. VIASPACE has provided system designs and preliminary cost estimates for CES. We have also traveled to Hawaii with CES to evaluate potential plantation sites. The Giant King Grass will be provided from the VIASPACE nursery in Hawaii. Giant King Grass, a natural non-genetically modified grass approved by the USDA, was successfully imported into Hawaii after meeting strict import requirements including 12 months of quarantine by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">Mr. McCabe Cox, Chief Operating Officer of Clean Energy Solutions, said, &ldquo;VIASPACE has provided timely support for our Hawaii projects -- for both agriculture and design and engineering of the biogas facility. We work well with VIASPACE. They have incorporated some advanced technology from CES partners that make the projects even more attractive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">Cox continued, &ldquo;Giant King Grass, when cut every two months, is excellent feed for dairy cows and beef cattle which can contribute to Hawaii&rsquo;s food sustainability. In the future, Giant King Grass could be used to produce liquid transportation fuels for Hawaii as well.&nbsp; CES is developing other renewable energy projects in addition to Hawaii, and we plan to work with VIASPACE on these as well.&rdquo;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">&#8203;<strong>About VIASPACE Inc.</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="MsoNormal">VIASPACE grows renewable Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass as a low-carbon fuel for clean electricity generation; for environmentally friendly energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio-methane production and for green cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials. Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass is a proprietary, high yield, dedicated biomass energy crop. Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass when it is cut frequently at 4 to 5 feet tall is also excellent animal feed. The USDA granted approval for planting Giant King<sup>&reg;</sup> Grass throughout the US and cooperates in exporting by performing the required inspections and issuing the phytosanitary certificate needed for import into foreign countries.

The thermal emissivity levels are monitored using an infrared detector with sensitivity range of less than fifty milliKelvin, and in some variations, about fifteen to thirty milliKelvin, such as a quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) equipped camera.  Based on differential emissivity calculations, a determination is made whether the monitored emissivity level corresponds to at least one calibrated emissivity level associated with an explosive material.  The monitored emissivity levels are calibrated to eliminate the effects of other synthetic objects such as clothing, personal items, and other harmless objects.  The monitored emissivity levels are also buffered against changes in environment. </p><p>The allowance of this new patent protects and validates VIASPACE Security&#39;s unique capabilities in using and tracking of large volumes of real-time infrared based sensor data.  This capability opens the potential to an entirely new generation of applications in defense and homeland defense surveillance that up until now were considered to be prohibitively expensive and difficult to pursue.</p>', 1, 59),

They operate silently, at relatively low temperatures and offer much longer operating time than today&#39;s batteries. Unlike a battery, DMFCs do not need to be recharged. They can provide electricity continuously to the consumer electronic devices as long as oxygen and fuel are supplied to the fuel cell.

Furthermore, this eliminates the need for consumers to carry electrical cords or adapters.</p><p>Methanol or methanol/water solution is the industry&#39;s choice of fuel.

Covering a broad spectrum of temperature (30&deg;-100&deg;C), the in-situ installation of the laser-based sensor head of the HS-1000 enables extremely precise readings of the molecular absorption of water vapor. Readings can be taken every 1-2 seconds to provide fuel cell designers with a continuous flow of accurate measurement of dew point and/or relative humidity via straight forward connection to any computer. The HS-1000 is both compact and lightweight, enabling its use in virtually any lab environment and simplifying data collection of a variety of experiments and/or validation tests. </p><h5 align="left">Fuel Cell Production</h5><p align="left">The HS-1000 VIASENSOR uses a non-contact, flow-through design to eliminate impact of contaminants in the gas, sensor damage or any drift in readings, even after accidental condensation on a sample cell. This stability of calibration is designed to last for an extensive amount of time with no maintenance required. The HS-1000 is also ideally suited for in-line validation of fuel cell performance on the production floor, as well as in the development lab. It can also supply a steady stream of real-time data for a wide variety of statistical analysis needed to ensure consistency of fuel cell performance. </p><h5 align="left">Fuel Cell Systems Maintenance</h5><p align="left">The HS-1000 VIASENSOR is a compact (15cm x 15cm x 5cm), lightweight (under 1 kg), highly accurate instrument that can be connected to virtually any laptop computer via the RS-232 serial port. Its calibration is designed to be literally maintenance free, making the HS-1000 the ideal instrument to measure the continued quality of gases flowing into hydrogen fuel cells via a T-connection to provide temporary gas or air line diversion and analysis in the field. The HS-1000 can also be modified to accept temporary, portable power from common ports found in most automotive vehicles today, enabling its use in remote or difficult access sites as well. </p><h5 align="left">Combustion Gases</h5><p align="left">The HS-1000 VIASENSOR uses a laser-based design that is independent of a particular gas composition or pressure in order to make measurements. There is negligible interference or drift from foreign elements of combustion or other contaminants, allowing the VIASENSOR to accurately measure the molecular absorption of water vapor in high temperature environments, such as analysis of a variety of combustion gases. The HS-1000 is not affected by common contaminants found in those environments, permitting a continuous, real-time plotting of dew point in high temperature applications. The HS-3000 uses the same non-contact laser absorption spectroscopy technology as the other members of the VIASENSOR Product Family. This model has been optimized to cover the range of water vapor concentration typically found in products of the combustion of hydrocarbons with air. This is particularly useful in measuring the water vapor content of the exhaust of an internal combustion engine during its warm-up period. Without this measurement it is nearly impossible to convert the concentrations of other exhaust gases to a &quot;dry basis&quot; as usually required by regulatory agencies. </p><p align="left">{Released August 2007} </p>', 1, 239),

The HS-1000 is both compact and lightweight, enabling its use in virtually any lab environment and simplifying data collection of a variety of experiments and/or validation tests.<br />Fuel Cell Production</p><p>The HS-1000 VIASENSOR uses a non-contact, flow-through design to eliminate impact of contaminants in the gas, sensor damage or any drift in readings, even after accidental condensation on a sample cell. This stability of calibration is designed to last for an extensive amount of time with no maintenance required. The HS-1000 is also ideally suited for in-line validation of fuel cell performance on the production floor, as well as in the development lab. It can also supply a steady stream of real-time data for a wide variety of statistical analysis needed to ensure consistency of fuel cell performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Fuel Cell Systems Maintenance</h4><p>The HS-1000 VIASENSOR is a compact (15cm x 15cm x 5cm), lightweight (under 1 kg), highly accurate instrument that can be connected to virtually any laptop computer via the RS-232 serial port. Its calibration is designed to be literally maintenance free, making the HS-1000 the ideal instrument to measure the continued quality of gases flowing into hydrogen fuel cells via a T-connection to provide temporary gas or air line diversion and analysis in the field. The HS-1000 can also be modified to accept temporary, portable power from common ports found in most automotive vehicles today, enabling its use in remote or difficult access sites as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Combustion Gases</h4><p>The HS-1000 VIASENSOR uses a laser-based design that is independent of a particular gas composition or pressure in order to make measurements. There is negligible interference or drift from foreign elements of combustion or other contaminants, allowing the VIASENSOR to accurately measure the molecular absorption of water vapor in high temperature environments, such as analysis of a variety of combustion gases. The HS-1000 is not affected by common contaminants found in those environments, permitting a continuous, real-time plotting of dew point in high temperature applications. The HS-3000 uses the same non-contact laser absorption spectroscopy technology as the other members of the VIASENSOR Product Family. This model has been optimized to cover the range of water vapor concentration typically found in products of the combustion of hydrocarbons with air. This is particularly useful in measuring the water vapor content of the exhaust of an internal combustion engine during its warm-up period. Without this measurement it is nearly impossible to convert the concentrations of other exhaust gases to a &quot;dry basis&quot; as usually required by regulatory agencies.</p><p>{Released August 2007} </p>', 1, 303),
