					<b>Giant King Grass is a very high-yield, non-genetically modified, perennial grass suitable for tropical and subtropical regions. It can be used as a dedicated energy crop -- as a low carbon, renewable replacement for coal and oil to generate electricity and heat, and as a nonfood feedstock for second-generation liquid biofuels to replace fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel, and for green biochemicals, bioplastics and biomaterials. Giant King Grass is also a feedstock for anaerobic digesters to produce biomethane which can be used to generate electricity or as a transportation fuel. When it is cut every 40-60 days at 4-7 feet tall, it is excellent high-protein feed for cattle, dairy cows, sheep, goats and other animals.</b>

					<b>VIASPACE can work with customers to establish a Giant King Grass plantation anywhere in the world. 
					<br/><br/>
					VIASPACE has business plans and financial models for Giant King Grass plantations, biomass power plants and biogas facilities.
					</b><br /><br />
					<br/><br/>
					<b>VIASPACE and its partners can deliver a Giant King Grass plantation and biomass power plant or biogas facility in 12 to 24 months.

					<b>
					ADVANTAGES OF GIANT KING GRASS FOR BIOENERGY	
					</b><br /><br />

					<b>
					Giant King Grass provides jobs for farmers and power plant and biorefinery employees.</b> Money stays in the country rather than being spent for imported oil.
					<br /><br />

					<b>
					Giant King Grass contributes to energy security and energy independence.
					</b><br /><br />

					<b>Giant King Grass is carbon neutral.</b> Photosynthesis converts solar energy and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into plant material (biomass). Burning plant material in a power plant releases the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is reabsorbed again when the next crop grows making it carbon neutral.
					<br /><br />

					<b>Giant King Grass can be burned-either directly or in pellet form as a replacement for coal or oil in electric power plants</b> to produce low-carbon electricity and industrial heat. </br></br>

					<b>Anaerobic digestion of Giant King Grass produces biomethane</b> that fuels an engine generator set to produce electricity or can be injected into the natural gas pipeline and used in many applications including transportation fuel.

					<br/>
					<b>Giant King Grass can be used as a feedstock to make liquid transportation biofuels</b> such as cellulosic ethanol, butanol and green gasoline and to produce biochemicals and bioplastics.<br /><br />

					<b>Giant King Grass is a non-food crop and can be grown on marginal lands which are not used for growing food.</b> Using food crops to produce biofuel is discouraged in many countries.
					<br /><br />

					<b>Giant King Grass is low cost because of its extremely high yield and meets the cost targets of green energy applications.</b><br /><br />

					<b>Giant King Grass can produce electricity 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</b> It provides firm base electricity, whereas solar and wind produce electricity only when it is sunny or windy.<br /><br />

					<b>Giant King Grass pellets can be used to replace up to 20% of coal in existing power plants</b> which reduces carbon emissions by 20% while preserving the large capital investment.<br/>
