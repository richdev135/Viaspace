					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><hr />

					<p>VIASPACE Inc. has created this privacy policy (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the VIASPACE website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Policy and will provide notification on the Site of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.</p>
					<h3>COLLECTED INFORMATION </h2>
					<p><p> We may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of VIASPACE.com, request information, or subscribe to email news update system(s). Specifically, VIASPACE may ask you to provide the following information: [Please include all personal information that may be collected at the site] (the foregoing and any additional information requested by VIASPACE, &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;).</p> <p> When you provide VIASPACE with your Personal Information, and you do not &lsquo;opt out,&rsquo; VIASPACE and VIASPACE representatives and affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to updated information, new products and services, and other VIASPACE information. Beyond its representatives and affiliates, VIASPACE does not offer or allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties. VIASPACE complies with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 in all email communications. VIASPACE respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users. </p></p>
					<h3>RESUME SUBMISSIONS</h2>
					<p>If you send a resume in response to a job opening posted on our Site, we will retain your Personal Information only for the purpose of filling the job opening and will not use it for any other purpose.   Please note that submission of a resume will not be via a secure site and we cannot guarantee that others will not view the data while it is being transmitted.  For that reason, we discourage the use of Social Security Numbers and other sensitive information in online resume transmissions.</p>
					<h3>COOKIES</h2>
					<p>When you interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer&rsquo;s hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. VIASPACE uses the data collected from web server logs and client-side cookies in aggregate form only and does not collect any personally identifiable information. We may use this information to help us better understand what users are seeking and learning at our Site and helps us identify potential navigation issues.  Further, we may utilize the services of partners to help manage and optimize our Site and communications.  Although our partners may log the information coming from the Site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. Any such partners are not permitted to use this information for any purpose other than to provide this service to us and these third parties are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
					<h3>PRIVACY</h2>
					<p><p> VIASPACE will always protect the Personal Information that you share with us. VIASPACE stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. As noted above in connection with the analysis of our Site, we might occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p> <p> Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared with outside entities except as set out in this Policy. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose your Personal Information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Site. </p></p>
					<h3>THIRD PARTY LINKS </h2>
					<p>As a resource to our visitors, we provide links to other websites.  The policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to those sites.  We suggest checking the privacy policies on each linked site directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies.</p>
					<h3>CHILDREN</h2>
					<p>You should be aware that this Site is not intended for, or designed to attract, children under the age of 13.  </p>
					<h3>OPT-OUT POLICY</h2>
					<p>VIASPACE offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after providing us with your Personal Information, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply send your request to [<a href="mailto:info@VIASPACE.com">info@VIASPACE.com</a>].</p>
					<h3>FEEDBACK</h2>
					<p>VIASPACE would like to receive your comments and questions about this Privacy Policy. Please address comments or questions regarding the VIASPACE Privacy Policy to info@VIASPACE.com. VIASPACE may occasionally update, amend, or change this Privacy Policy based on user feedback and as needed or appropriate. If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here. We will use information in accordance with the version of our Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. Users will always have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in accordance with, and in respect to, the posted Privacy Policy.</p>
