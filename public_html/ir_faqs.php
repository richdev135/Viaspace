					<br /><a name="faqs_0"></a><h3>1. What is VIASPACE?</h2>
					<p>VIASPACE licenses Giant King<sup>&reg</sup> Grass as a low-carbon fuel for electricity generating power plants; for energy pellets; and as a feedstock for bio methane production and cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials. When cut more frequently, Giant King Grass is an excellent animal feed for cattle, dairy cows, sheep, goats, camels and other animals.
					Proprietary Giant King Grass is the highest yielding biomass crop in the world. Bio-electricity, biogas, biofuels, biochemicals, bioplastics, and biomaterials all need biomass as feedstock, and Giant King Grass is suitable for these applications. Because of its high yield, it is a low-cost feedstock. Equally important, Giant King Grass provides the reliable and well-characterized feedstock that is required by banks and investors in order to provide financing for these bioenergy projects. Giant King Grass is a natural plant, and is not genetically modified and not an invasive species.
